Additionally, in any action affecting the family, which includes all of the actions mentioned, a court or family court commissioner may order temporary child support during the pendency of the action.\\n\\nThis bill provides that in a paternity action, annulment, divorce or legal separation, unless the parties have otherwise agreed in writing, a court may not order a party to pay child support for a child who is 16 or 17 years old if the child is not enrolled in a school program or a high school equivalency program, including a home-based private educational program, unless the child has graduated from high school or been granted a declaration of high school graduation equivalency.  The prohibition applies to both child support and family support, which is a combination of child support and maintenance (alimony), and to temporary orders during the pendency of an action as well as to final orders. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\\nAB272, s. 1\\n\\n\\n5Section \\n1.  767.23 (1) (c) of the statutes is amended to read:\\nAB272,2,5\\n1767.23 (1) (c)  Requiring Subject to sub.

To be employed in a street trade, a minor must obtain an identification card and the minor's employer must obtain a permit from the department of industry, labor and human relations (DILHR) or from a local permit officer designated by DILHR.  A minor may be employed only during certain hours designated by DILHR so that the minor's employment does not interfere with school attendance.\\n\\nThis bill permits a minor who is at least 11 years of age to be employed in the sale of newspapers if the usual permit procedure is followed.  Work in street trades other than newspaper sales and fund-raising sales remains limited to those minors who are at least 12 years of age.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\\nAB273, s. 1\\n\\n\\n5Section \\n1.  103.23 (2) of the statutes is renumbered 103.23 (2) (a).\\nAB273, s. 2\\n\\n\\n6Section \\n2.  103.23 (2) (b) of the statutes is created to read:\\nAB273,2,2\\n1103.23 (2) (b)  A minor who is at least 11 years of age may be employed or 2permitted to work in the sale or distribution of newspapers.\\nAB273, s. 3\\n\\n\\n3Section \\n3.  103.67 (2) (c) of the statutes is amended to read:\\nAB273,2,74\\n103.67 (2) (c)  Minors 11 years of age or older may be employed in the sale or 5distribution of newspapers, minors  12 years of age or older may be employed in other 6street trades, and any minor may work in fund-raising sales for nonprofit 7organizations, public schools or private schools, as provided in ss. 103.21 to 103.31.\\nAB273, s. 4\\n\\n\\n8Section \\n4.  103.71 (2) (a) of the statutes is renumbered 103.71 (2) (a) (intro.) 9and amended to read:\\nAB273,2,1010\\n103.71 (2) (a) (intro.)

Referred to Committee on State Affairs.\\n\\nAB274,1,5\\n1An Act to repeal 125.07 (1) (b) 2. b. and 125.07 (1) (b) 5.; to amend 125.07 (1) 2(b) 1., 125.07 (1) (b) 2.  (intro.), 125.07 (1) (b) 2. a., 125.07 (1) (b) 2. c. and 125.07 3(1) (b) 2. d.; to repeal and recreate 125.07 (1) (b) 3.; and to create 125.07 (1) 4(b) 3m. of the statutes; relating to: sale of alcohol beverages to underage 5persons and providing a penalty.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\\n\\nUnder current law, with certain exceptions, no person may provide or sell alcohol beverages to a person younger than the legal drinking age of 21 years of age (underage person).  A person who violates this prohibition may be subject to a forfeiture of up to $500 or, if the person committed a prior offense within the previous 30 months, to a fine of up to $10,000 or imprisonment for not longer than 9 months, or both a fine and imprisonment.  The maximum fine and term of imprisonment depend on the number of violations committed within the previous 30 months.  These penalties do not apply to a person who holds a license or permit for the retail sale of alcohol beverages (license or permit holder).  Instead, a license or permit holder who provides or sells alcohol beverages to an underage person is subject to having his or her license or permit suspended for a period of up to 30 days.\\n\\nThis bill eliminates the time period for counting previous violations and changes the penalties that apply.  Also under the bill, license and permit holders are subject to the same forfeiture, fines and imprisonment as other violators.  Under the bill, the penalties for a violation are as follows:\\n\\n1)  For a first violation, a mandatory forfeiture of not less than $500 nor more than $1,000.\\n\\n2)  For a 2nd violation, a mandatory fine of not less than $1,000 nor more than $2,000 and imprisonment for not less than 30 days nor more than 90 days. In addition, if the violator is a license or permit holder a court must suspend the violator's license or permit for not less than 30 days nor more than 90 days.\\n\\n3)  For a 3rd or subsequent violation, a mandatory fine of not less than $2,000 nor more than $10,000 and imprisonment for not less than 90 days nor more than 9 months.  In addition, if the violator is a license or permit holder a court must revoke the violator's license or permit.\\n\\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\\nAB274, s. 1\\n\\n\\n1Section \\n1.  125.07 (1) (b) 1. of the statutes is amended to read:\\nAB274,2,92\\n125.07 (1) (b) 1.

This bill eliminates this provision of current law.  By cross-reference, the bill also applies to stock insurance corporations.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\\nAB275, s. 1\\n\\n\\n3Section \\n1.  180.0622 (2) (a) of the statutes is renumbered 180.0622 (2) and 4amended to read:\\nAB275,1,85\\n180.0622 (2)  Except as provided in par.
