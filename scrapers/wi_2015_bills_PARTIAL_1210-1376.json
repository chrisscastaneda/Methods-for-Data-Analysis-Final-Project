Taylor, Subeck, Zamarripa, Sinicki, Johnson, Kahl and Bowen. Referred to Committee on Health and Human Services.\n\nSB28,1,4\n1An Act to repeal 979.01 (1r); to amend 979.01 (1) (intro.) and 979.01 (1g); and 2to create 16.009 (2) (q), 146.82 (2) (a) 8m., chapter 156 and 979.01 (1j) of the 3statutes; relating to: permitting certain individuals to make requests for 4medication for the purpose of ending their lives and providing penalties.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nThis bill permits an individual who is of sound mind, is not incapacitated, is at least 18 years of age, is a resident of Wisconsin, and has a terminal disease to request voluntarily medication from his or her attending physician for the purpose of ending the individual's life in a humane and dignified manner.  The bill authorizes the individual's attending physician to issue a prescription for the medication if specified requirements are met.  Further, the bill creates a statutory request for medication authorization form and requires that the Department of Health Services (DHS) prepare and provide copies of the form for distribution to certain facilities, associations, and persons.\n\nThe bill establishes the following requirements that must be met before an individual's attending physician may issue a prescription in response to the individual's request for medication:\n\n1.  First, the requester must orally ask his or her attending physician for the medication.  Then, not fewer than 15 days later, the requester must again request the medication, using a valid request form that is substantially in the form specified in the bill, is in writing, is signed in the presence of three qualified witnesses and dated by the requester, is made voluntarily, and is filed in the requester's patient health care record.  After the written request is filed, the requester must orally ask his or her attending physician a second time for the medication.  The attending physician may not prescribe a medication to fulfill a request for medication until at least 48 hours after the second oral request.\n\n2.  The requester's attending physician must determine that the requester meets the requirements for making the request; must inform the requester of his or her diagnosis and prognosis, the probable results of taking the prescribed medication, and the alternatives to doing so; must refer the requester to a consulting physician for review; must, if the requester may be suffering from a psychiatric or psychological disorder, refer the requester to a psychiatrist or psychologist for review; must, in the requester's patient health care record, document certain information and certify that requirements have been met regarding the request; must ask the requester to inform his or her next of kin about the request; must inform the requester that the request is revocable and offer him or her the opportunity to revoke it; and must report information about the request to DHS on a form prescribed by DHS.\n\n3.  A consulting physician to whom the requester is referred must medically confirm the attending physician's diagnosis and determination that the requester meets the requirements for making the request.  Any psychologist or psychiatrist to whom the requester is referred by the attending or consulting physician must determine and certify in writing that the requester is not suffering from a psychiatric or psychological disorder, including depression, that causes impaired judgment.\n\nThe bill specifies that, if the requester is a resident of a nursing home or community-based residential facility, at least one of the witnesses to the written request for medication must be a residents' advocate designated by the Board on Aging and Long-Term Care.  The bill also specifies procedures by which a requester may revoke a request for medication and provides that making a request for medication does not revoke or otherwise modify a declaration to physicians or health care power of attorney that a requester may have.  The bill provides that making a request for medication does not constitute attempted suicide and that taking medication under a fulfilled request does not constitute suicide.  The bill establishes penalties for certain actions with regard to the request for medication, but prohibits a health care facility or health care provider from being charged with a crime, being held civilly liable, or being charged with unprofessional conduct for failing to fulfill a request (except that an attending physician who refuses to fulfill a valid request and fails to make a good faith attempt to transfer the requester to another physician who will fulfill the request may be charged with unprofessional conduct), for fulfilling a valid request, or for acting contrary to or failing to act on a revocation of a request unless the health care facility or health care provider has actual knowledge of the revocation.\n\nThis bill also provides that, when a patient dies as a result of a request for medication under the bill, a physician or other person having knowledge of the death need not report the death to the sheriff, medical examiner, or coroner of the county or the police chief of the community where the death took place, as is required for certain deaths, including suicides, under current law.\n\nBecause this bill creates a new crime or revises a penalty for an existing crime, the Joint Review Committee on Criminal Penalties may be requested to prepare a report concerning the proposed penalty and the costs or savings that are likely to result if the bill is enacted.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB28,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  16.009 (2) (q) of the statutes is created to read:\nSB28,3,22\n16.009 (2) (q)  Designate residents' advocates under s. 156.19.\nSB28,2\n\n\n3Section \n2.  146.82 (2) (a) 8m. of the statutes is created to read:\nSB28,3,44\n146.82 (2) (a) 8m.

Before a school may participate in SAGE, the school board of the district must enter into a contract with the department of public instruction (DPI) on behalf of individual schools in the district that qualify for participation.  SAGE contracts are for 5 years and may be renewed for additional 5-year terms.\n\nThis bill allows DPI to provide a one-year extension on existing SAGE contracts set to expire at the end of the current 2014-15 school year.  The bill also prohibits DPI from renewing 5-year SAGE contracts expiring at the end of the 2014-15 school year or any school year thereafter.\nSB31,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  118.43 (2) (f) of the statutes is created to read:\nSB31,2,42\n118.43 (2) (f)  The department and a school board may agree to extend an 3achievement guarantee contract entered into or renewed in the 2010-11 school year 4for one year under existing contract terms.\n\nNote:  Provides that existing SAGE contracts set to expire at the end of the current 2014-15 school year may be extended by one year under the existing contract terms.\n\nThe one-year extension of SAGE contracts allows legislative changes to the SAGE program enacted during the 2015-16 school year to be implemented in the 2016-17 school year.  Without an extension, the 354 SAGE contracts set to expire at the end of the current 2014-15 school year will likely be renewed before legislation changing the SAGE program is enacted.  If the existing SAGE contracts are not extended, legislative changes to the SAGE program enacted during the 2015-16 school year will not apply to SAGE contracts renewed at the end of 2014-15 school year until the contracts are renewed again in 2020-21.\nSB31,2\n\n\n5Section \n2.  118.43 (2) (g) of the statutes is renumbered 118.43 (2) (g) 1.\nSB31,3\n\n\n6Section \n3.  118.43 (2) (g) 2. of the statutes is created to read:\nSB31,2,97\n118.43 (2) (g) 2.

The statutory requirements include: (a) reducing class sizes to no larger than 18 students to one classroom teacher, or 30 students to two classroom teachers; (b) ensuring that certain education and human services are available in the school; (c) ensuring that a rigorous curriculum is provided; and (d) providing staff development and requiring professional staff accountability.\n\nBefore an eligible school may participate in SAGE, the school board of the district must enter into a contract with the Department of Public Instruction (DPI) on behalf of the school.  SAGE contracts are for five years and may be renewed for additional five-year terms.\n\nThis bill creates a program entitled \"Achievement Gap Reduction\" (AGR) under a new section of the statutes.  The new program is similar to the SAGE program and incorporates many existing aspects of the SAGE program; however, it prevents DPI from entering into any new SAGE contracts or renewing any existing SAGE contracts.\n\nThe new AGR program is similar to SAGE in the following key aspects:\n\n• The AGR program targets funding to schools with low-income students.  Participating schools are subject to a five-year contract between the school district and DPI.  The contract requires the school to meet certain conditions.\n\n• The AGR program makes a school district eligible to sign an AGR contract on behalf of a school that is subject to a SAGE contract on the effective date of the bill.  It does not authorize any AGR contracts for schools not currently in SAGE.\n\n• The AGR program allows a participating school to meet the obligations of its contract by limiting classroom ratios to 18:1 or 30:2, provided the school district also provides professional development for teachers on small group instruction.\n\n• The AGR program is also subject to a required annual evaluation.\n\n• No AGR contract may contain a waiver of AGR requirements.  School districts are currently prohibited from requesting waivers of SAGE requirements.\n\nThe new AGR program differs from the existing SAGE program in the following key aspects:\n\n• The AGR program allows a school to meet its obligations under the contract by using one of three strategies, or a combination of these strategies: (a) one-to-one tutoring provided by a licensed teacher; (b) instructional coaching for teachers provided by a licensed teacher; or (c) maintaining 18:1 or 30:2 classroom ratios and providing professional development on small group instruction.  Unlike SAGE, the AGR program does not require all participating grades to meet the 18:1 or 30:2 classroom ratios in order to receive funding.\n\n• The AGR program requires a participating school to create performance goals, including reduction of the achievement gap between low-income students in that school and students in the same grade and subject statewide.\n\n• The AGR program requires school board review of implementation and progress toward achieving performance objectives in each participating school every semester.\n\n• The AGR program is funded by a sum sufficient appropriation at the per-pupil level currently received by SAGE participants ($2,027).\nSB32,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  20.255 (2) (cu) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB32,2,42\n20.255 (2) (cu)  Achievement guarantee gap reduction contracts.  \nThe amounts 3in the schedule for A sum sufficient for aid to school districts and the program 4evaluation under s. ss. 118.43 and 118.44.\n\nNote:  Amends the name of the existing SAGE appropriation and appropriates a sum sufficient to fund the new achievement gap reduction contracts authorized by the bill.\nSB32,2\n\n\n1Section \n2.  118.38 (1) (a) 9. of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB32,3,42\n118.38 (1) (a) 9.

The three strategies include: (a) small class sizes of 18:1 or 30:2 and professional development related to small group instruction; (b) data-driven instructional coaching for teachers; or (c) data-informed one-to-one tutoring for students at risk of difficulty with math or reading.\n\nAn AGR contract must also require annual reporting to DPI.  A school district must report at the beginning of the school year what strategies it intends to use, and must report by the end of the year what strategies it did use.\n\nFurther, an AGR contract must require a school to set performance objectives that include reducing the achievement gap for low-income pupils in math and reading and to specify the assessments the school will use to determine if it achieved the objectives.\n\nFinally, an AGR contract must require a school to describe its implementation of the program and report its objectives and its success in achieving them to the school board every semester.\nSB32,6,12\n9(5)  Contract renewals.

(4).\n\nNote:  Prohibits DPI from renewing an AGR contract with a school district on behalf of any school that fails to comply with the contractual requirements.\nSB32,7,2\n1(6)  State aid.  (a) In this subsection, \"amount appropriated\" means the amount 2under s. 20.255 (2) (cu) in any fiscal year less $250,000.\nSB32,7,63\n(b)  From the appropriation under s. 20.255 (2) (cu), the department shall pay 4to each school district that has entered into a contract with the department under 5this section $2,027.25 multiplied by the number of low-income pupils enrolled in a 6participating grade.\nSB32,7,87\n(c)  The school board shall use the aid under this section to satisfy the terms of 8the contract.\nSB32,7,119\n(d)  The department shall cease payments under this section to any school 10district if the school board withdraws from the contract before expiration of the 11contract.\nSB32,7,1312\n(e)  The department shall promulgate rules to implement and administer the 13payment of state aid under this subsection.\nSB32,7,1814\n(f)  Limitations on payment.

The Section applies the existing appropriation and funding for the SAGE program to the newly created AGR program, but changes the appropriation from a sum certain to a sum sufficient to provide the per-pupil amount awarded to schools participating in SAGE in the 2013-14 school year.  While current law establishes a maximum per-pupil payment of $2,250 for each low-income SAGE pupil, the current appropriation of $108.9 million was not sufficient to provide the full per-pupil payment and therefore payments were prorated for 2013-14 at 90.1 percent, resulting in a per-pupil payment of $2,027.25.\n\nUnlike the SAGE program, the AGR program requires the school district to return the funds paid for a participating grade for any school year in which the school does not implement the strategies required under the AGR contract under sub. (4) in that grade.\n\nAs in the SAGE statute, the Section maintains the $250,000 allocation for evaluation of the program and requires DPI to promulgate rules regarding payment of state aid.\nSB32,8,3\n1(7)  Evaluation.  (a)  Beginning in the 2017-18 school year, the department shall 2arrange for an annual evaluation of the program under this section and shall allocate 3from the appropriation under s. 20.255 (2) (cu) $250,000 for that purpose.\nSB32,8,64\n(b)  The entity performing the evaluation under this subsection shall distribute 5each such evaluation to each school district that has entered into a contract under 6sub. (3).\n\nNote:  Requires DPI to arrange for yearly evaluation of the AGR program following the first year of implementation.  As in the SAGE statute, the subsection also budgets $250,000 for this evaluation.  Unlike the SAGE statute, the subsection requires the evaluation to be sent to each participating school district.\nSB32,8,77\n(End)\n            Down\r\n        Down\r\n\r\n    \r\n"

Current law defines \"restaurant\" to include any public or private school lunchroom for which food service is provided by contract, but excludes from the definition of \"restaurant\" any public or private school lunchroom for which food service is directly provided by the school.  A person may obtain an FPP certificate by satisfactorily completing an examination that is approved by DHS and allows an individual to demonstrate basic knowledge of food protection practices or by achieving comparable compliance.  An FPP certificate is valid for five years and may be renewed if the holder of the FPP certificate satisfactorily completes an approved examination.\n\nThis bill provides that no person may conduct, maintain, manage, or operate a school lunchroom that is in a school that is participating in the federal National School Lunch Program and for which food service is directly provided by the school unless the operator or manager of the lunchroom, or his or her designee, holds a valid FPP certificate issued by DHS.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB34,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  254.71 (1m) of the statutes is created to read:\nSB34,2,62\n254.71 (1m)  No person may conduct, maintain, manage, or operate a school 3lunchroom that is in a school that is participating in the national school lunch 4program under 42 USC 1751 to 1769j for which food service is directly provided by 5the school unless the operator or manager of the lunchroom, or his or her designee, 6is a certificate holder.\nSB34,2,77\n(End)\n            Down\r\n        Down\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n"

Current law also requires the firearms dealer to wait 48 hours after receiving notice that DOJ received the request for a background check, without receiving notice that state or federal law prohibits the purchaser from possessing a firearm, before transferring the handgun to the purchaser.  This bill eliminates the 48-hour waiting period.  Under this bill, the dealer may transfer the handgun immediately after receiving notice from DOJ that the background check indicates that the purchaser is not prohibited from possessing a firearm.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB35,1\n\n\n4Section \n1.  175.35 (title) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB35,1,5\n5175.35 (title)  Waiting period for purchase Purchase of handguns.\nSB35,2\n\n\n1Section \n2.  175.35 (1) (ar) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB35,2,52\n175.35 (1) (ar)  \"Firearms dealer\" means any person engaged in the business 3of importing, manufacturing or dealing in firearms and having a license as an 4importer, manufacturer or dealer issued by the U.S. department of the treasury 5federal government.\nSB35,3\n\n\n6Section \n3.  175.35 (2) (d) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB35,2,117\n175.35 (2) (d)  Forty-eight hours, subject to extension under sub.

Referred to Committee on Agriculture, Small Business, and Tourism.\n\nSB37,1,5\n1An Act to amend 125.07 (3) (a) 3., 125.32 (3) (c) and 125.68 (4) (c) 4.; and to 2create 125.02 (11m) and 125.32 (3m) (i) of the statutes; relating to: the 3issuance of retail alcohol beverage licenses for premises on which another 4business is conducted and the presence of underage persons on premises 5operating under a retail alcohol beverage license.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nUnder current law, with limited exceptions, no person may sell alcohol beverages to a consumer unless the seller possesses a license or permit authorizing the sale.  A Class \"B\" license authorizes the retail sale of fermented malt beverages (beer) for consumption on or off the premises.  A Class \"B\" license is also a prerequisite to the issuance of a \"Class B\" license, which authorizes the sale of intoxicating liquor (wine and distilled spirits).\n\nCurrent law generally prohibits the issuance of a Class \"B\" license for any premises where another business is conducted.  However, there are exceptions to this prohibition, including for hotels, restaurants, bowling centers, and movie theaters.\n\nThis bill creates an additional exception to this prohibition for a painting studio.  A painting studio is defined in the bill as an establishment that is primarily engaged in the business of providing instruction in the art of painting and that offers customers the opportunity to purchase food and beverages for consumption while they paint.\n\nUnder current law, a person who is under 21 years of age and not accompanied by his or her parent, guardian, or spouse who is at least 21 years of age (unaccompanied underage person) may not enter or be on any premises for which a license or permit for the retail sale of alcohol beverages has been issued (licensed premises).  Current law also provides for various exceptions to this prohibition.  Among the exceptions, an unaccompanied underage person may enter or be on licensed premises that is a hotel, bowling center, movie theater, or center for the visual or performing arts.\n\nThis bill creates an additional exception allowing an unaccompanied underage person to enter or be on licensed premises that is a painting studio.\n\nFor further information see the local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB37,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  125.02 (11m) of the statutes is created to read:\nSB37,2,52\n125.02 (11m)  \"Painting studio\" means an establishment that is primarily 3engaged in the business of providing to customers instruction in the art of painting 4and that offers customers the opportunity to purchase food and beverages for 5consumption while they paint.\nSB37,2\n\n\n6Section \n2.  125.07 (3) (a) 3. of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB37,2,147\n125.07 (3) (a) 3.

Referred to Committee on Health and Human Services.\n\nSB39,1,2\n1An Act to amend 253.13 (1); and to create 253.13 (1g) of the statutes; \nrelating 2to: newborn screening for certain lysosomal storage disorders.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nUnder current law, the attending physician or nurse-midwife must ensure that every infant born undergoes testing for certain congenital and metabolic disorders prior to the infant's discharge from the hospital or maternity home.  For infants born elsewhere, the attending physician, nurse-midwife, or other birth attendant must ensure that the infant is tested within a week of birth.  As authorized by current law, the Department of Health Services (DHS) specifies by rule the congenital and metabolic disorders for which newborn infants are to be screened.  Current law allows an exception to the testing requirement if the parents or legal guardian object on the basis of a conflict with religious tenets and practices or with their personal convictions.\n\nThis bill requires that, in addition to the other congenital and metabolic disorders for which testing is currently required under DHS rules, the attending physician, nurse-midwife, or in certain circumstances, other birth attendant, must ensure that every infant born undergoes testing for certain lysosomal storage disorders, specifically, globoid cell leukodystrophy, also known as Krabbe disease; Fabry disease, Pompe disease; Niemann-Pick disease; Gaucher disease, and Hurler syndrome, also known as mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I).  For infants born in a hospital or maternity home, the attending physician or nurse-midwife must ensure this testing is completed before the infant is discharged from the hospital or within one week of birth, if the infant has not yet been discharged.  For births occurring outside a hospital or maternity home setting, the attending physician, nurse-midwife, or other birth attendant must ensure testing is done within one week of birth.  The parental objection exemption under current law also applies to the testing required under this bill.\n\nFor further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB39,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  253.13 (1) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB39,2,82\n253.13 (1)  Tests; requirements.

Referred to Committee on Judiciary and Public Safety.\n\nSB43,1,5\n1An Act to renumber 968.26 (1) and 978.045 (1r) (a) to (h); to renumber and 2amend 968.20 (1) (intro.), 968.26 (3), 978.045 (1r) (intro.) and 978.045 (1r) (i); 3to amend 173.12 (1m); and to create 968.26 (1b), 968.26 (4), 968.26 (5) and 4968.26 (6) and (7) of the statutes; \nrelating to: John Doe proceedings and 5providing a penalty.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nUnder current law governing John Doe hearings, if a district attorney requests a judge to convene a proceeding to make a determination of whether a crime has been committed, the judge must convene a proceeding to make the determination.  If a person who is not a district attorney complains to a judge that he or she has reason to believe a crime has been committed, the judge must refer the complaint to a district attorney.  The district attorney has 90 days to issue charges; if the district attorney does not issue charges, the district attorney must forward to the judge with jurisdiction all law enforcement reports, all records and cases files, and a written explanation for not issuing charges.  If that judge determines a proceeding is necessary to determine if a crime has been committed, the judge must convene a proceeding.\n\nUnder current law, any conduct that is prohibited by state law and punishable by fine or imprisonment or both is a crime that may be investigated under a John Doe proceeding.  Under this bill, the crimes that may be investigated under a John Doe proceeding are certain felonies under the Criminal Code or any conduct punishable by fine or imprisonment or both that is allegedly committed by an on-duty law enforcement officer, corrections officer, or state probation, parole, or extended supervision officer.\n\nUnder current law, the judge who convenes a John Doe proceeding has discretion as to whether to keep the proceeding secret and may issue a secrecy order that extends to every participant in the proceeding.  Under this bill, a judge may enter a secrecy order upon a showing of good cause by the district attorney, but the order may apply only to the judge, the district attorney or other prosecuting attorney, law enforcement personnel, interpreters, and reporters who make or transcribe a record of the proceeding.  Any person who violates a secrecy order is subject to a fine of up to $10,000, imprisonment for up to nine months, or both.\n\nThis bill imposes a six-month time limit on a John Doe proceeding.  This limit may be extended for additional six-month periods if a majority of judicial administrative district chief judges find good cause for each extension.  This bill also provides that the same finding is required to add specified crimes to the original complaint.  The vote of each judge must be available to the public.\n\nFinally, under this bill, records reflecting the costs of John Doe investigations and proceedings are a matter of public record, temporary or permanent reserve judges are excluded from presiding over John Doe proceedings, and special prosecutors may be appointed to assist the district attorney in a John Doe proceeding only under certain conditions.\n\nBecause this bill creates a new crime or revises a penalty for an existing crime, the Joint Review Committee on Criminal Penalties may be requested to prepare a report concerning the proposed penalty and the costs or savings that are likely to result if the bill is enacted.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB43,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  173.12 (1m) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB43,3,22\n173.12 (1m)  If an animal has been seized because it is alleged that the animal 3has been used in or constitutes evidence of any crime specified in s. 951.08, the 4animal may not be returned to the owner by an officer under s. 968.20 (2).

Specifically, the bill requires the board to do all of the following:\n\n1.  Conduct a study to determine the feasibility of establishing a plan.  The feasibility study must estimate the potential population that is likely to choose to participate in the plan and the potential cost of implementing the plan and must recommend a design and structure for the plan that is most reasonable in light of that potential population and cost.\n\n2.  Hold public hearings to receive testimony relating to the feasibility study and the recommended design and structure of the plan.  The board must hold not less than five public hearings and must hold those hearings over a period of not more than three months.  The board may hold no more than one public hearing in Madison and must ensure that at one least one public hearing is held in each geographic area of the state, including the southeastern part of the state, the western part of the state, the northern part of the state, and the northeastern part of the state.\n\n3.  Based on the feasibility study, the recommended design and structure of the plan, and the testimony received at the public hearings, design the plan.

Larson, Murphy, Thiesfeldt, Tittl and Weatherston. Referred to Committee on Health and Human Services.\n\nSB46,1,3\n1An Act to create 253.155 and 948.215 of the statutes; relating to: causing harm 2to a child by cosleeping while intoxicated, providing information about safe 3sleep, and providing a penalty.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nUnder this bill, no person may injure or kill a child under 12 months of age by cosleeping, while the person is intoxicated, with the child.  Under the bill, if the child suffers bodily harm as a consequence, the person is guilty of a Class H felony, if the child suffers great bodily harm as a consequence, the person is guilty of a Class F felony, and if the child dies as a consequence, the person is guilty of a Class D felony.\n\nThe bill requires the Child Abuse and Neglect Prevention Board (board) to purchase, prepare, or arrange with a nonprofit organization to prepare printed and audiovisual materials relating to cosleeping while intoxicated.  The materials must include information regarding safe sleep and the dangers of cosleeping while intoxicated.  The board must make the materials available to certain entities and may satisfy that requirement by making the materials available, at no charge, on its Internet site.  Under the bill, the board or nonprofit organization is immune from any damages resulting from any good faith act or omission in preparing or distributing the materials.\n\nThe bill requires a physician, a nurse-midwife, or another trained, designated health care provider to provide to a pregnant woman, free of charge and during a prenatal health care appointment in her third trimester of pregnancy, a copy of the board's printed materials, and to inform the woman of, and make available to her to view, the board's audiovisual materials.  Under the bill, if after a child is born, the mother's medical records do not indicate she received the materials at a prenatal appointment, a physician, a nurse-midwife, a birth attendant, or another trained, designated health care provider must provide to each parent of the infant who is present, before the mother is discharged from the hospital or maternity home, a copy of the printed materials and inform them of the board's audiovisual materials.  At the same time the materials are provided to the mother or parents, the person who provided the materials must provide the parent with a form, prepared by the board, that includes a statement that the parent has been advised of the risks of cosleeping with an infant while that parent is intoxicated and a statement that the parent will share that information with all persons who provide care for the infant.  Under the bill, a hospital, maternity home, physician, nurse-midwife, other staff member of the hospital or maternity home, or birth attendant is immune from liability for any damages resulting from any good faith act or omission in providing the board's materials and form.\n\nThe bill also requires certain individuals and entities to provide the board's materials to specified individuals.  The bill requires each school board to provide or arrange with a nonprofit organization or health care provider to provide age-appropriate instruction relating to safe sleep, including dangers of cosleeping while intoxicated, for pupils in one of grades 10 to 12.  A county department or Indian tribe that provides home visitation services and providers of prenatal, postpartum, and young child care coordination services must provide to recipients of those services a copy of the board's printed materials and give an oral explanation of those materials.  Under the bill, a county department, a nonprofit organization, a school board, a health care provider, an Indian tribe, or a provider of prenatal, postpartum, and young child care coordination is immune from liability for any damages resulting from any good faith act or omission in connection with providing the training or materials.\n\nBecause this bill creates a new crime or revises a penalty for an existing crime, the Joint Review Committee on Criminal Penalties may be requested to prepare a report concerning the proposed penalty and the costs or savings that are likely to result if the bill is enacted.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB46,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  253.155 of the statutes is created to read:\nSB46,2,2\n2253.155  Safe sleep.

Under this bill, the secretary of natural resources is nominated by the Natural Resources Board, and with the advice and consent of the senate appointed, for a four-year term.  As the appointing body, the Natural Resources Board may remove the secretary from office at any time.  The bill provides that the secretary in office when the bill takes effect serves a four-year term beginning when the bill takes effect.\n\nUnder current law, when an appointive state office that has a specific term becomes vacant, because of a resignation or removal, for example, the new appointee is appointed for the rest of the unexpired term.  Under this bill, when the office of secretary of natural resources becomes vacant, the new appointee serves a full four-year term beginning when he or she is appointed.\n\nUnder current law, the Natural Resources Board consists of seven members nominated by the governor, and with the advice and consent of the senate appointed, for six-year terms.  As with members of other state boards, a member of the Natural Resources Board may continue to serve after the expiration of his or her term until a successor is nominated and the senate consents to the nomination.  This bill provides that the position of a member of the Natural Resources Board nominated after January 1, 2016, becomes vacant upon the expiration of the member's term.  This change triggers the application of a current provision under which the governor may provisionally fill a vacancy, without the consent of the senate.  The provisional appointment remains in effect until the senate acts on the appointment.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB48,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  15.05 (1) (c) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB48,2,42\n15.05 (1) (c)  The secretary of natural resources shall be nominated by the 3governor natural resources board, and with the advice and consent of the senate 4appointed, to serve at the pleasure of the governor \nfor a 4-year term.\nSB48,2\n\n\n5Section \n2.  15.34 (2) (a) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB48,2,86\n15.34 (2) (a)  The natural resources board shall consist of 7 members appointed 7for staggered 6-year terms.  Upon the expiration of the term of a member nominated 8after January 1, 2016, the position that was held by the member is vacant.\nSB48,3\n\n\n9Section \n3.  17.20 (1) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB48,2,1710\n17.20 (1)  General.  Vacancies in appointive state offices shall be filled by 11appointment by the appointing power and in the manner prescribed by law for 12making regular full term appointments thereto, and appointees to fill vacancies 13therein shall hold office for the residue of the unexpired term or, if no definite term 14of office is fixed by law, until their successors are appointed and qualify, except that 15an appointee to fill a vacancy in the office of secretary of natural resources is 16appointed to a full 4-year term beginning on the date of appointment and 17qualification.\nSB48,4\n\n\n18Section \n4.\nNonstatutory provisions.\nSB48,3,3\n1(1)  The secretary of natural resources serving on the effective date of this 2subsection shall serve a 4-year term beginning on the effective date of this 3subsection.\nSB48,3,44\n(End)\n            Down\r\n        Down\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n"

The prevailing wage laws include three separate laws: one that applies to certain projects of public works to which the state or any state agency is a party (state prevailing wage law), one that applies to certain projects of public works undertaken by local governments (local prevailing wage law), and one that applies to projects under a contract based on bids to which the state is a party for the construction or improvement of highways (highway prevailing wage law).  Projects to which the prevailing wage laws do not apply include:  1) single-trade projects of public works for which the estimated project cost of completion is less than $48,000; 2) multiple-trade projects of public works for which the estimated project cost of completion is less than $100,000; and 3) with respect to the local prevailing wage law, multiple-trade projects of public works erected, constructed, repaired, remodeled, or demolished by a private contractor for a city or village having a population of less than 2,500 or for a town for which the estimated project cost of completion is less than $234,000.  Also under current law, no local government may enact or administer a prevailing wage law ordinance or any similar ordinance.\n\nThis bill eliminates the state prevailing wage law, the local prevailing wage law, and the highway prevailing wage law but retains the prohibition against local governments enacting or administrating their own prevailing wage laws or similar ordinances.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB49,1\n\n\n3Section \n1.  19.36 (3) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB49,3,6\n119.36 (3)  Contractors' records.

The board may also require 13any elective or appointive county official to keep his or her office at the county seat 14in an office to be provided by the county.  All such officers shall keep their offices open 15during the usual business hours of any day except Sunday, as the board directs.  With 16proper care, the officers shall open to the examination of any person all books and 17papers required to be kept in his or her office and permit any person so examining 18to take notes and copies of such books, records, papers, or minutes therefrom except 19as authorized in par.

Referred to Committee on Economic Development and Commerce.\n\nSB50,1,10\n1An Act to repeal 66.1105 (5) (bg), 66.1105 (6) (am) 4., 66.1105 (6) (dm) 1., 66.1105 2(6) (dm) 3. a., 66.1105 (6) (dm) 4. and 66.1105 (6) (e) 1. c.; and to amend 60.85 3(4) (b) 2., 66.0602 (3) (dm), 66.1105 (4) (gm) 5., 66.1105 (4) (h) 1., 66.1105 (4e) 4(b) 3., 66.1105 (4m) (b) 2., 66.1105 (4m) (b) 2m., 66.1105 (6) (a) 7., 66.1105 (6) (a) 58., 66.1105 (6) (e) 1. b., 66.1105 (7) (am) 2., 66.1105 (7) (am) 3. and 66.1106 (3) 6(b) 2. of the statutes; relating to: industrial zoning requirements in tax 7incremental districts, planning commission notice for tax incremental district 8amendments, obsolete references relating to tax incremental districts, 9allocation of tax increments, joint review board review, and calculation of levy 10limits following dissolution of a tax incremental district.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nThis bill is explained in the Notes provided by the Joint Legislative Council in the bill.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\n\nJoint Legislative Council prefatory note:  This bill was prepared for the Joint Legislative Council's Study Committee on Review of Tax Incremental Financing.\n\nIndustrial Zoning Requirements in Tax Incremental Districts\n\nUnder current law, a resolution to create a tax incremental district (TID) must include a finding that not less than 50 percent, by area, of the real property within the district is at least one of the following: a blighted area; in need of rehabilitation or conservation work; suitable for industrial sites and zoned for industrial use; or suitable for mixed-use development.  The resolution must also confirm that any real property within the district that is found suitable for industrial sites and is zoned for industrial use will remain zoned for industrial use for the life of the tax incremental district, and must declare that the district is a blighted area district, a rehabilitation or conservation district, an industrial district, or a mixed-use district based on the identification and classification of the property included within the district.\n\nThe bill specifies that the requirement related to maintenance of industrial zoning applies only to districts that are declared to be industrial districts.\n\nPlanning Commission Notice for TID Amendments\n\nUnder current law, a TID's project plan may be amended for several reasons, including modification of the expenditures allowed in a TID's project plan, addition or subtraction of territory to the TID's boundaries, extension of the TID's lifespan, and donation of tax increments to another TID.\n\nGenerally, the process to amend a TID's project plan is similar to the process of creating a TID, requiring a public hearing held by the planning commission and adoption of resolutions by the planning commission, municipality, and joint review board (JRB) to approve the plan or amendment.  As part of this process, the planning commission must publish a class 2 notice of its public hearing.  The JRB must publish notice of its meeting as a class 1 notice, at least five days before the meeting.\n\nUnder current law, a class 2 notice consists of insertions of the notice for two consecutive weeks, with the last insertion at least a week prior to the meeting date, in the appropriate newspaper of record under ch. 985, stats.  A class 1 notice, unless otherwise specified (for example, the requirement that the JRB must publish a notice five days before its meeting), requires a single insertion of the notice, at least a week prior to the meeting date, in the appropriate newspaper of record.\n\nThe bill amends the notice requirement of the planning commission from a class 2 notice to a class 1 notice with regard to notices relating to the TID amendment process.\n\nObsolete References\n\nOver time, the statutes relating to tax incremental financing have been amended to include numerous provisions that are significantly limited in their scope, often relating to a single municipality or a particular TID.  Often, these amendments offer special statutory authorization regarding creation, amendment, or lifespan of a particular district or class of districts, or to TIDs in a particular municipality.\n\nThe bill repeals certain provisions of the statutes relating to tax incremental financing that the Department of Revenue (DOR) identified as obsolete.\n\nTiming Penalty\n\nUnder current law, certain statutory and administrative deadlines relating to the allocation of positive tax increments to a TID combine to result in variation in the maximum number of positive increments that may be allocated to a TID, depending on the date on which a municipality acted to create the TID and its project plan.  In particular, the maximum number of positive increments that a TID may receive is one fewer for a TID and project plan created after September 30 and before May 15 than for TIDs created on or after May 15 and before October 1.\n\nFor newly created TIDs, the bill extends a TID's lifespan and allocation period of positive tax increments by one year if the municipality that creates the TID adopts the project plan for the TID after September 30 and before May 15.\n\nJoint Review Board Review Period\n\nBefore a municipality's resolution to create a TID, amend a TID's project plan, or require DOR to redetermine a TID's base value may take effect, several steps are required.  One of these steps is JRB approval of a municipality's TID resolution.  A JRB consists of members who represent the overlying taxation districts.  In general, the JRB must approve the resolution by a majority vote within 30 days after receiving the resolution.  The review period applicable to an industry-specific TID located in a town and an environmental remediation TID is not less than 10 days nor more than 30 days.\n\nThe bill amends the maximum review period the JRB has to approve a municipality's TID resolution from 30 days to 45 days after receiving the resolution.\n\nCalculation of Levy Limit Exception\n\nGenerally, under the current local levy law, and subject to a number of exceptions, a city, village, town, or county (political subdivision) may not increase its base levy (the prior year's actual levy) in any year by more than the percentage change in the political subdivision's equalized value due to new construction, less improvements removed, including new construction that occurs in a TID between the previous year and the current year, but not less than 0 percent.  Also, when determining its levy limit, a municipality must exclude the amount of any tax increment generated by property in a TID located in the municipality.\n\nThere are numerous exceptions that may be used to adjust a political subdivision's levy limit.  One exception authorizes an increase in a municipality's levy limit for the year that a TID terminates.  If DOR does not certify a TID as a result of the district's termination, the levy limit otherwise applicable is increased by an amount equal to the municipality's maximum allowable levy for the preceding year, multiplied by a percentage equal to 50 percent of the amount determined by dividing the terminated TID's value increment by the municipality's equalized value, as determined by DOR. The increase must be applied to the municipality's levy limit in the year that the TID terminates.\n\nThe bill specifies that the municipality's equalized value for the preceding year, as used in the calculation of the levy limit exception for the year that a TID terminates, excludes the value of any TID value increments.\nSB50,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  60.85 (4) (b) 2. of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB50,3,52\n60.85 (4) (b) 2.  No tax incremental district may be created and no project plan 3may be amended unless the joint review board approves the resolution adopted 4under sub. (3) (h) or (j) 1. by a majority vote not less than 10 days nor more than 30 545 days after receiving the resolution.\n\nNote:  This Section extends the maximum review period that the JRB has to approve the creation or amendment of an industry-specific town TID from 30 days to 45 days.\nSB50,2\n\n\n6Section \n2.  66.0602 (3) (dm) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB50,4,10\n166.0602 (3) (dm)  If the department of revenue does not certify a value 2increment for a tax incremental district for the current year as a result of the 3district's termination, the levy increase limit otherwise applicable under this section 4in the current year to the political subdivision in which the district is located is 5increased by an amount equal to the political subdivision's maximum allowable levy 6for the immediately preceding year, multiplied by a percentage equal to 50 percent 7of the amount determined by dividing the value increment of the terminated tax 8incremental district, calculated for the previous year, by the political subdivision's 9equalized value, exclusive of any tax incremental district value increments, for the 10previous year, all as determined by the department of revenue.\n\nNote:  This Section excludes the value of any TID increments from the calculation of the levy limit exception that applies for the year a TID terminates.\nSB50,3\n\n\n11Section \n3.  66.1105 (4) (gm) 5. of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB50,4,1512\n66.1105 (4) (gm) 5.

The amendment is subject 19to approval by the local legislative body and approval requires the same findings as 20provided in par. (g) and, if the amendment adds territory to a district under subd. 2., 21approval also requires the same findings as provided in par. (gm) 4. c.  Any 22amendment to a project plan is also subject to review by a joint review board, acting 1under sub. (4m).  Adoption of an amendment to a project plan shall be preceded by 2a public hearing held by the plan commission at which interested parties shall be 3afforded a reasonable opportunity to express their views on the amendment.  Notice 4of the hearing shall be published as a class 2 1 notice, under ch. 985.  The notice shall 5include a statement of the purpose and cost of the amendment and shall advise that 6a copy of the amendment will be provided on request.  Before publication, a copy of 7the notice shall be sent by 1st class mail to the chief executive officer or administrator 8of all local governmental entities having the power to levy taxes on property within 9the district and to the school board of any school district which includes property 10located within the proposed district.  For a county with no chief executive officer or 11administrator, this notice shall be sent to the county board chairperson.\n\nNote:  This Section amends the notice a planning commission must provide with regard to consideration of a TID amendment.\nSB50,5\n\n\n12Section \n5.  66.1105 (4e) (b) 3. of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB50,5,1613\n66.1105 (4e) (b) 3.

With regard to a multijurisdictional tax incremental district created 1under this section, each public member of a participating city must be part of the 2majority that votes for approval of the resolution or the district may not be created.  3The board may not approve the resolution under this subdivision unless the board's 4approval contains a positive assertion that, in its judgment, the development 5described in the documents the board has reviewed under subd. 1. would not occur 6without the creation of a tax incremental district.  The board may not approve the 7resolution under this subdivision unless the board finds that, with regard to a tax 8incremental district that is proposed to be created by a city under sub. (17) (a), such 9a district would be the only existing district created under that subsection by that 10city.\nSB50,7\n\n\n11Section \n7.  66.1105 (4m) (b) 2m. of the statutes is amended to read:\n            Down\r\n        Down\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Up\r\n        Up\r\nSB50,6,1812\n66.1105 (4m) (b) 2m.

Referred to Committee on Economic Development and Commerce.\n\nSB51,1,8\n1An Act to repeal 60.85 (6) (e) and 66.1105 (3) (g); to renumber and amend 266.1105 (6m) (c) and 66.1106 (10) (a); to amend 60.85 (4) (a) 1., 60.85 (8) (c) 3(intro.), 66.1105 (4m) (a) and 66.1106 (3) (a); and to create 60.85 (4) (d), 60.85 4(6) (f), 60.85 (8) (c) 1. to 7., 66.1105 (4m) (f), 66.1105 (6m) (c) 1. to 7., 66.1105 (6m) 5(e), 66.1106 (3) (e), 66.1106 (10) (a) 1. to 7. and 66.1106 (10m) of the statutes; 6relating to: standing joint review boards, annual joint review board meetings, 7annual reports on tax incremental districts, and granting rule-making 8authority.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nThis bill is explained in the Notes provided by the Joint Legislative Council in the bill.\n\nFor further information see the local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\n\nJoint Legislative Council prefatory note:  This bill was prepared for the Joint Legislative Council's Study Committee on Review of Tax Incremental Financing (TIF).\n\nJoint Review Boards and Tax Incremental District Annual Reports\n\nBackground\n\nUnder current law, a city or village may create a tax incremental financing district (TID) in part of its territory to foster economic development or to conduct environmental remediation.  Currently, towns and counties also have a limited ability to create a TID under certain circumstances.  Any city, village, town, or county (political subdivision) that seeks to create a TID, amend a TID project plan, have a TID's base redetermined, or incur project costs for an area that is outside of the TID's boundaries must convene a Joint Review Board (JRB).  The JRB may be a temporary body, with a membership comprised of the city, village, or town; county; school district; and technical college district; and one public member.  Alternatively, a political subdivision that creates a TID under general TIF authority (s. 66.1105, stats.), may choose instead to create a standing JRB.  By a majority vote, a temporary JRB may disband following approval or rejection of the proposal.  A standing JRB, however, may remain in existence for the entire time that any TID created under s. 66.1105, stats., exists in the political subdivision, except that the political subdivision may disband a standing JRB at any time.\n\nAlso under current law, the political subdivision must prepare and make available to the public an updated annual report describing the status of each existing TID, including expenditures and revenues.  The political subdivision must also send a copy of the report by May 1, annually, to each overlying taxing jurisdiction (county, school district, technical college district, lake sanitary district, public inland lake protection and rehabilitation district, and town sanitary district).\n\nThe Bill\n\nThe bill requires a political subdivision to always convene a standing JRB in order to create a TID, including an industry-specific town TID or an environmental remediation TID, and requires the standing JRB to remain in existence for the entire time that any TID exists in the political subdivision with the same overlying taxing jurisdictions as the overlying taxing jurisdictions represented on the standing JRB.  The standing JRB may, by majority vote, disband following the termination of all existing TIDs located in the political subdivision with the same overlying taxing jurisdictions as the overlying taxing jurisdictions represented on the standing JRB.  The standing JRB must also meet annually to review the political subdivision's annual report that describes the status of each existing TID to review the performance and status of each existing TID.  It must meet on July 1, or as soon as the updated annual report becomes available.\n\nThe political subdivision must submit the annual report describing the status of each existing TID to each overlying taxing jurisdiction as well as the Department of Revenue (DOR), by July 1, annually.  The copy of the annual report filed with DOR must be in electronic format and DOR must, by rule, create the format for the submission of the annual reports that a political subdivision must use when electronically filing the reports with DOR.  The annual report must contain at least all of the following information:\n\n• The name assigned to the TID.\n\n• The classification of the TID that is included in the project plan and the scope of the project.\n\n• The name of any developer who is named in a developer's agreement with the political subdivision of who receives any financial assistance from tax increments allocated for the TID.\n\n• The date that the city expects the TID to terminate.\n\n• The amount of tax increments to be deposited into a special fund for that TID.\n\n• An analysis of the special fund for the TID that includes all of the following:\n\n○ The balance in the special fund at the beginning of the fiscal year.\n\n○ All amounts deposited in the special fund by source, including amounts received from another TID.\n\n○ An itemized list of all expenditures from the special fund by category of permissible project costs.\n\n○ The balance in the special fund at the end of the fiscal year, including a breakdown of that balance by source and a breakdown of that balance identifying any portion of the balance that is required, pledged, earmarked, or otherwise designated for payment of or securing of obligations and anticipated project costs.  Any portion of such ending balance that has not been identified or is not identified as being required, pledged, earmarked, or otherwise designated for payment of or securing of obligations or anticipated project costs shall be designated as surplus.\n\n• The contact information of the person designated by the political subdivision to respond to questions or concerns regarding the annual report.\n\nDOR must post on its official Internet site the annual reports describing the status of an existing TID no later than 45 days after it receives the annual report.  However, DOR may grant a political subdivision an extension of time for submitting the annual report if the political subdivision provides DOR with sufficient evidence that the report is in the process of being completed.  DOR must post on its official Internet site, a list of political subdivisions that receive an extension of time for submitting the annual report, the time period of the extension, and whether the municipality timely filed the annual report within the extension of time.\n\nAlso, DOR must notify a political subdivision that its annual report is past due if the political subdivision does not timely file its annual report, DOR must charge the political subdivision a fee of $100 per day for each day that the annual report is past due.  Because the bill does not specify where the fee should be deposited, the fees will be deposited in the common school fund.\n\nIndustry-Specific Town Tax Incremental Districts\n\nBackground\n\nAny town may create an industry-specific TID for certain agricultural, forestry, manufacturing, or tourism projects.  Any town may also create an industry-specific TID for residential development or retail development.  However, the residential development must have a necessary and incidental relationship to an agricultural, forestry, manufacturing, or tourism project; and the retail development must be limited to the retail sale of products that are produced due to an agricultural, forestry, or manufacturing project.\n\nCurrent law provides a process by which DOR may review an industry-specific town TID and issue a determination as to whether the money expended, or debt incurred, by the TID in the prior year complied with the requirement that the town only expend money or incur monetary obligations for the type of projects allowed under current law.  Any of the following persons, including persons residing outside of the town, may file no later than July 1, a written request with DOR for such a review:\n\n• An owner of taxable property that is located in the town that has created the district.\n\n• An owner of taxable property that is located in a taxing jurisdiction which overlies the town in which the district is located (e.g. county, school districts, technical college districts, sewerage districts, and public inland lake protection and rehabilitation districts).\n\n• An owner of taxable property in a city or village that borders the town in which the district is located.\n\n• A taxing jurisdiction that overlies the town in which the district is located (e.g. county, school districts, technical college districts, sewerage districts, public inland lake protection, and rehabilitation districts).\n\n• A city or village that borders the town in which the district is located.\n\nDOR may deny any request for review if DOR believes, based on a review of the request, that insufficient grounds exist to support the alleged noncompliance.  DOR must send written notification of its decision to the person who made the request for review and to the town.  If DOR grants a request for review that is made under this paragraph, it must hold a hearing and send written notification of the hearing to all of the following:  (1) the clerk of the town that created the industry-specific town TID; (2) the person who requested the review; (3) the clerk of each overlying taxing jurisdiction; and (3) the clerk of every city or village that borders the town.  The written notification shall include the time, date, and location of the hearing.\n\nThe secretary of revenue, or the secretary's designee, shall preside at the hearing and shall receive testimony and evidence on all issues that are related to the request for review.  Following the hearing, the DOR secretary must make a determination that either the town is in compliance or that the town made expenditures or incurred debts that are not allowed under current law.  If the secretary makes a determination of noncompliance, the secretary must either order:  (1) the town to pay back all ineligible costs to the district's overlying taxing jurisdictions, on a proportional basis that relates to each jurisdiction's share of the tax increment, from funds other than tax increments; or (2) the TID to be terminated.  If the secretary orders the district to be terminated, the town becomes liable for all unpaid project costs actually incurred which are not paid from the special fund which contain the industry-specific town TID's allocated tax increments.  Current law also allows any person or unit of government that received a notice to appeal the secretary's decision to the circuit court in Dane County.\n\nCurrent law does not provide a similar review process applicable to a TID created by a city or village under s. 66.1105, stats., or to an environmental remediation TID.\n\nThe Bill\n\nThis bill repeals the entire process, described above, relating to DOR's review and determination as to whether the money expended, or debt incurred, by an industry-specific town TID complied with current law.\nSB51,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  60.85 (4) (a) 1. of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB51,5,232\n60.85 (4) (a) 1.  Any town that seeks to create a tax incremental district or 3amend a project plan shall convene a standing joint review board to review the 4proposal.  If a town creates more than one tax incremental district consisting of 5different overlying taxing jurisdictions, it shall create a separate standing joint 6review board for each combination of overlying jurisdictions, except that if a town 7creates a tax incremental district under this section and s. 66.1105 that share the 8same overlying taxing jurisdictions, the town may create one standing joint review 9board for the districts.  The joint review board shall remain in existence for the entire 10time that any tax incremental district exists in the town with the same overlying 11taxing jurisdictions as the overlying taxing jurisdictions represented on the standing 12joint review board.  Except as provided in subd. 2., and subject to par. (am), the joint 1review board shall consist of one representative chosen by the school district that has 2power to levy taxes on the property within the tax incremental district, one 3representative chosen by the technical college district that has power to levy taxes 4on the property within the tax incremental district, one representative chosen by the 5county that has power to levy taxes on the property within the tax incremental 6district, one representative chosen by the town and one public member.  If more than 7one school district, more than one union high school district, more than one 8elementary school district, or more than one technical college district has the power 9to levy taxes on the property within the tax incremental district, the unit in which 10is located property of the tax incremental district that has the greatest value shall 11choose that representative to the joint review board.  The public member and the 12joint review board's chairperson shall be selected by a majority of the other joint 13review board members before the public hearing under sub. (3) (a) or (j) 1. is held.  14All joint review board members shall be appointed and the first joint review board 15meeting held within 14 days after the notice is published under sub. (3) (a) or (j) 1.  16Additional meetings Meetings of the joint review board in addition to the meeting 17required under this subdivision or par. (d) shall be held upon the call of any member.  18The town that seeks to create the tax incremental district or to amend its project plan 19shall provide administrative support for the joint review board.  By majority vote, the 20joint review board may disband following approval or rejection of the proposal the 21termination under sub. (9) of all existing tax incremental districts in the town with 22the same overlying taxing jurisdictions as the overlying taxing jurisdictions 23represented on the joint review board.\n\nNote:  This Section requires a town to create a standing JRB that must remain in existence for the entire time that any TID exists in the town with the same overlying taxing jurisdictions as the overlying taxing jurisdictions represented on the JRB.  If a town creates an industry-specific town TID and a TID under s. 66.1105, stats., and both TIDs share the same overlying taxing jurisdictions, the town may use the same standing JRB for both TIDs.  Also a standing JRB may, by majority vote, disband following the termination of all existing TIDs located in the town with the same overlying district as the overlying taxing jurisdictions represented on the JRB.\nSB51,2\n\n\n1Section \n2.  60.85 (4) (d) of the statutes is created to read:\n            Down\r\n        Down\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Up\r\n        Up\r\nSB51,6,52\n60.85 (4) (d)  A joint review board shall meet annually on July 1, or when an 3annual report under sub. (8) (c) becomes available, to review annual reports under 4sub. (8) (c) and to review the performance and status of each district governed by the 5board.\n\nNote:  This Section requires a standing JRB to meet annually on July 1, or as soon as the updated annual report describing the status of each existing industry-specific town TID becomes available.  The purpose of the annual meeting is to review the performance and status of each existing industry-specific town TID.\nSB51,3\n\n\n6Section \n3.  60.85 (6) (e) of the statutes is repealed.\n\nNote:  This Section repeals the entire process described above, relating to DOR's review and determination as to whether the money expended, or debt incurred, by an industry-specific town TID complied with current law.\nSB51,4\n\n\n7Section \n4.  60.85 (6) (f) of the statutes is created to read:\nSB51,6,108\n60.85 (6) (f) 1.

Notwithstanding sub. (8) (c), if a town provides the department of revenue 16with sufficient evidence that an annual report is in the process of being completed, 17the department of revenue may grant an extension of time for submitting the report.  18The department shall post on its official Internet site a list of towns that have 1received an extension granted under this subdivision, the period of the extension, 2and an indication of whether the town timely filed the report within the extension.\nSB51,7,63\n4.  If an annual report is not timely filed under subd. 3. or sub. (8) (c), the 4department of revenue shall notify the town that the report is past due.  If the town 5does not file the report within 60 days of the date on the notice, the department shall 6charge the town a fee of $100 per day for each day that the report is past due.\n\nThis Section requires DOR to create a format for towns to use for the submission of annual reports describing the status of each existing TID that are to be electronically filed to DOR.  DOR must create this format by rule.  DOR must post on its official Internet site the annual reports filed with it no later than 45 days after it receives the annual report.  However, DOR may grant a municipality an extension of time for filing the annual report if the municipality provides DOR with sufficient evidence that the report is in the process of being completed.  DOR must post on its official Internet site a list of towns that received an extension of time for filing the annual report, the time period of the extension, and whether the municipality timely filed the annual report within the extension of time.\n\nAlso under this Section, DOR must notify a town that its annual report is past due if the town does not file the annual report by July 1, or within the extension of time granted by DOR.  Under this Section, if the town does not file the required annual report within 60 days of the notice, DOR must charge the town a fee of $100 per day for each day that the annual report is past due.\nSB51,5\n\n\n7Section \n5\n.  60.85 (8) (c) (intro.) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB51,7,148\n60.85 (8) (c) (intro.)

(2) shall convene a standing joint review board 3to review the proposal.  If a political subdivision creates more than one tax 4incremental district under this section consisting of different overlying taxing 5jurisdictions, it shall create a separate standing joint review board for each 6combination of overlying jurisdictions, except that if a political subdivision creates 7a tax incremental district under this section and s. 66.1105 that share the same 8overlying taxing jurisdictions, the political subdivision may create one standing joint 9review board for the districts.  The joint review board shall remain in existence for 10the entire time that any tax incremental district exists in the political subdivision 11with the same overlying taxing jurisdictions as the overlying taxing jurisdictions 12represented on the standing joint review board.  The board shall consist of one 13representative chosen by the school district that has power to levy taxes on the 14property that is remediated, one representative chosen by the technical college 15district that has power to levy taxes on the property, one representative chosen by 16the county that has power to levy taxes on the property that is remediated, one 17representative chosen by the city, village or town that has power to levy taxes on the 18property that is remediated and one public member.  If more than one city, village or 19town, more than one school district, more than one technical college district or more 20than one county has the power to levy taxes on the property that is remediated, the 21unit in which is located property that has the greatest value shall choose that 22representative to the board.  The public member and the board's chairperson shall 23be selected by a majority of the other board members at the board's first meeting.  24All board members shall be appointed and the first board meeting held within 14 25days after the political subdivision's governing body approves the written proposal 1under sub.

Referred to Committee on Economic Development and Commerce.\n\nSB52,1,9\n1An Act to repeal 66.1105 (6) (f) 2. (intro.), 66.1105 (6) (f) 2. a., 66.1105 (6) (f) 2. 2b. and 66.1105 (6) (f) 2. c.; to renumber 66.1105 (14); \nto renumber and amend 366.1105 (6) (f) 2. d.; to amend 66.1105 (2) (i), 66.1105 (6) (e) 1. a., 66.1105 (6) 4(f) 1. a., 66.1105 (14) (title), 66.1106 (2) (c) and 66.1106 (7) (e) (intro.); and to 5create 66.1105 (6) (h) and 66.1105 (14) (b) of the statutes; relating to: 6modifying the requirements for sharing tax increments by tax incremental 7districts, limiting the participation of certain special purpose districts in tax 8incremental district financing, and authorizing any tax incremental district to 9use allocated tax increments donated from another tax incremental district.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nThis bill is explained in the Notes provided by the Joint Legislative Council in the bill.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\n\nJoint Legislative Council prefatory note:  This bill was prepared for the Joint Legislative Council's Study Committee on Review of Tax Incremental Financing.\n\nBackground\n\nUnder the current tax incremental financing program, a city or village may create a tax incremental district (TID) in part of its territory to foster development if at least 50 percent of the area to be included in the TID is blighted, in need of rehabilitation or conservation, suitable for industrial sites, or suitable for mixed-use development.  Currently, towns and counties also have a limited ability to create a TID under certain circumstances.  Also under current law, once a TID has been created, the Department of Revenue (DOR) calculates the \"tax incremental base\" value of the TID, which is the equalized value of all taxable property within the TID at the time of its creation.  If the development in the TID increases the value of the property in the TID above the base value, a \"value increment\" is created.  That portion of taxes collected on the value increment in excess of the base value is called a \"tax increment.\"  The tax increment is placed in a special fund that may be used only to pay back the project costs of the TID.\n\nA TID is required to terminate, under current law and with some exceptions, once its project costs are paid back.  Under one of the exceptions, the city, village, town, or county (political subdivision) may amend the TID's project plan to allow the positive tax increments from the TID (\"donor\" TID) to be allocated to another TID (\"recipient\" TID) also created by the political subdivision.  Positive tax increments may not be allocated from a donor TID to a recipient TID unless all of the following conditions have been met:\n\n• Both the donor and recipient TIDs are in the same municipality and have the same overlying taxing jurisdictions (county, school district, technical college district, lake sanitary district, a public inland lake protection and rehabilitation district, and a town sanitary district).\n\n• The donor TID has first satisfied all of its current-year debt service and project cost obligations.\n\n• The allocation of tax increments is approved by the Joint Review Board (JRB).\n\nIf both the donor TID and recipient TID were created before October 1, 1995 (or before October 1, 1996, for first class cities) the donor TID may, in general, allocate its positive tax increments for up to 10 years if all of the following conditions are met:\n\n• The donor TID and the recipient TID have the same overlying taxation jurisdictions.\n\n• The donor TID is able to demonstrate, based upon the positive tax increments that are currently generated, that it has sufficient revenues to pay for all project costs that have been incurred under the project plan for the district and sufficient surplus to pay for some of the eligible costs of the recipient TID.\n\nAlso, under current law, not all types of TIDs may be a recipient TID and use donated tax increments.  Donated tax increments may only be used if one of the following applies to the recipient TID:\n\n• The project costs in the recipient TID are used to create, provide, or rehabilitate low-cost housing or to remediate environmental contamination.\n\n• The recipient TID was created upon a finding that not less than 50 percent, by area, of the real property within the TID is blighted or in need of rehabilitation.\n\n• The recipient TID is a mixed-use or industrial-use district that has been designated as a distressed TID or a severely distressed TID.\n\n• The recipient TID is an environmental remediation TID.\n\nThe Bill\n\nUnder the bill, for TIDs that exist on the effective date of the bill, such donor TIDs may share tax increments notwithstanding the fact that they do not have the same overlying taxation jurisdictions as the donee districts if the dissimilarity is because one of the districts includes a lake sanitary district, a public inland lake protection and rehabilitation district, or a town sanitary district (special districts).  Also, for TIDs created on or after the day the bill takes effect, special districts may not participate in the financing of a TID.  Lastly, this bill allows any type of TID to be a recipient TID and use donated tax increments.\nSB52,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  66.1105 (2) (i) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB52,3,132\n66.1105 (2) (i)  \"Tax increment\" means that amount obtained by multiplying the 3total county, city, school and other local general property taxes levied on all taxable 4property within a tax incremental district in a year by a fraction having as a 5numerator the value increment for that year in the district and as a denominator that 6year's equalized value of all taxable property in the district.  In any year, a tax 7increment is \"positive\" if the value increment is positive; it is \"negative\" if the value 8increment is negative.  With regard to a tax incremental district created on or after 9the effective date of this paragraph .... [LRB inserts date], the calculation of a tax 10increment may not include general property taxes levied by a lake sanitary district, 11as defined in s. 30.50 (4q), a public inland lake protection and rehabilitation district 12organized under ch. 33, or a town sanitary district organized under subch. IX of ch. 1360.\n\nNote:  This Section amends the definition of a tax increment to exclude general taxes levied by lake sanitary districts, public inland lake protection and rehabilitation districts, and town sanitary districts from the calculation of a tax increment for any TID created on or after the effective date of this bill.  The bill also excludes these general taxes from the allocation of tax increments from a donor TID to a recipient TID.\nSB52,2\n\n\n14Section \n2\n.  66.1105 (6) (e) 1. a. of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB52,3,1715\n66.1105 (6) (e) 1. a.

The exception is created in Section 9 of the bill and applies to an existing TID.\nSB52,4\n\n\n1Section \n4\n.  66.1105 (6) (f) 2.

There is no limit to the number of project plan amendments that may be made if they are related to the projects included in the original plan.  However, only four amendments modifying the TID's boundaries by either adding or subtracting parcels are allowed.  Also, a TID that has been in a decrement situation for two years in a row may, after amending its project plan, adopt a resolution requiring the Department of Revenue (DOR) to redetermine the tax incremental base of the TID, but may do so only once during the life of the TID.\n\nAlso under current law, a TID must terminate when the political subdivision has received aggregate tax increments with respect to the TID in an amount equal to pay all of the TID's project costs, when the political subdivision dissolves the TID by resolution, or when the TID reaches its maximum lifespan, whichever is earlier.  A political subdivision may, however, request that the JRB extend the life of the TID if the TID is unable to pay off its project costs within the maximum lifespan of the TID.  The maximum lifespan of a TID, and the extension to this lifespan allowed under current law, are as follows:\n\n•  For any TID created before October 1, 1995:  the maximum lifespan is 27 years and the political subdivision may not request an extension to this lifespan.\n\n•  For a TID that was created between October 1, 1995 and September 30, 2004, and is blighted or in need of rehabilitation or conservation:  the maximum life is 27 years and the political subdivision may request a four-year extension.\n\n•  For a TID that was created between October 1, 1995 and September 30, 2004, and is an industrial district:  the maximum life is 23 years and the political subdivision may not request an extension to this lifespan.\n\n•  For a TID that was created on or after October 1, 2004, and is blighted or in need of rehabilitation or conservation:  the maximum lifespan is 27 years and the political subdivision may request a three-year extension.\n\n•  For a TID that was created on or after October 1, 2004, and is an industrial district or mixed-use district:  the maximum lifespan is 20 years and the political subdivision may request a three-year extension.\n\nThe Bill\n\nThis bill allows a political subdivision to make any type of amendment to the project plan of a TID created under s. 66.1105, stats., or to request an additional five-year extension to the TID's maximum lifespan at any time during the life of the TID, or both, if during the life of a TID, the annual and total amount of tax increments to be generated over the life of the district are adversely impacted by one or more of the following:\n\n•  An amendment to the provisions of TIF law found under s. 66.1105, stats.\n\n•  A change made by DOR to the equalized valuation method.\n\n•  A change made by 2013 Wisconsin Act 145 (2013 Act 145) that increased state aid to technical college districts in order to reduce the total statewide levy of technical college districts.\nSB53,1\n\n\n1Section \n1\n.  66.1105 (4) (h) 2. of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB53,3,52\n66.1105 (4) (h) 2.

With regard to the exceptions to this restriction, current law specifies that the restriction does not apply to property in a TID if the district is suitable for either industrial sites or mixed use development and the local legislative body implements an approved project plan to promote industrial development or mixed-use development.  Current law defines \"vacant property\" to include property where the fair market value or replacement cost value of structural improvements on the parcel is less than the fair market value of the land, and excludes property relating to the Park East and Park West freeway corridors in Milwaukee County, and also excludes property that is contaminated by environmental pollution.\n\nAdditionally, under current law, the Department of Revenue must certify the initial tax incremental base of a TID.  Generally, this value is calculated as the aggregate value of all taxable property in the TID, plus the value of all tax-exempt city-owned property, except real property owned by a city and used for police and fire buildings, administrative buildings, libraries, community and recreational buildings, parks, streets and improvements within any street right-of-way, parking facilities, and utilities.\n\nThe Bill\n\nThis bill removes the restriction that property standing vacant may not comprise more than 25 percent of the area in a TID for TIDs created after the effective date of the bill.\n\nAdditionally, for a TID created on or after the effective date of the bill, the bill revises the calculation of the initial tax incremental base of the district to exclude all tax-exempt city-owned property.\nSB54,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  66.1105 (4) (gm) 1. of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB54,3,242\n66.1105 (4) (gm) 1.  Describes the boundaries, which may, but need not, be the 3same as those recommended by the planning commission, of a tax incremental 4district with sufficient definiteness to identify with ordinary and reasonable 5certainty the territory included in the district.  The boundaries of the tax incremental 6district may not include any annexed territory that was not within the boundaries 7of the city on January 1, 2004, unless at least 3 years have elapsed since the territory 8was annexed by the city, unless the city enters into a cooperative plan boundary 9agreement, under s. 66.0301 (6) or 66.0307, with the town from which the territory 10was annexed, or unless the city and town enter into another kind of agreement 11relating to the annexation except that, notwithstanding these conditions, the city 12may include territory that was not within the boundaries of the city on January 1, 12004, if the city pledges to pay the town an amount equal to the property taxes levied 2on the territory by the town at the time of the annexation for each of the next 5 years.  3If, as the result of a pledge by the city to pay the town an amount equal to the property 4taxes levied on the territory by the town at the time of the annexation for each of the 5next 5 years, the city includes territory in a tax incremental district that was not 6within the boundaries of the city on January 1, 2004, the city's pledge is enforceable 7by the town from which the territory was annexed.  The boundaries shall include only 8those whole units of property as are assessed for general property tax purposes.  9Property For a tax incremental district created before the effective date of this 10subdivision .... [LRB inserts date], property standing vacant for an entire 7-year 11period immediately preceding adoption of the resolution creating a tax incremental 12district may not comprise more than 25 percent of the area in the tax incremental 13district, unless the tax incremental district is suitable under subd. 4. a. for either 14industrial sites or mixed use development and the local legislative body implements 15an approved project plan to promote industrial development within the meaning of 16s. 66.1101 if the district has been designated as suitable for industrial sites, or 17mixed-use development if the district has been designated as suitable for mixed-use 18development.  In this subdivision, \"vacant property\" includes property where the fair 19market value or replacement cost value of structural improvements on the parcel is 20less than the fair market value of the land.  In this subdivision, \"vacant property\" 21does not include property acquired by the local legislative body under ch. 32, property 22included within the abandoned Park East freeway corridor or the abandoned Park 23West freeway corridor in Milwaukee County, or property that is contaminated by 24environmental pollution, as defined in s. 66.1106 (1) (d).\n\nNote:  This Section removes the restriction that property standing vacant may not comprise more than 25 percent of the area in a TID for TIDs created after the date on which the bill takes effect.\nSB54,2\n\n\n1Section \n2\n.  66.1105 (4) (k) of the statutes is repealed.\nSB54,3\n\n\n2Section \n3.  66.1105 (5) (b) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB54,4,173\n66.1105 (5) (b)  Upon application in writing by the city clerk, in a form 4prescribed by the department of revenue, the department shall determine according 5to its best judgment from all sources available to it the full aggregate value of the 6taxable property and, except as provided in par.

Referred to Committee on Economic Development and Commerce.\n\nSB55,1,5\n1An Act to amend 66.1105 (4) (gm) 4. c., 66.1105 (5) (bn), 66.1105 (5) (bo), 66.1105 2(5) (bt), 66.1105 (10) (c), 66.1105 (12) (intro.), 66.1105 (12) (b), 66.1105 (16) (d), 366.1105 (17) (title) and (a) (intro.), 66.1105 (17) (a) 3., 66.1105 (17) (c) (intro.), 466.1105 (18) (c) 3. and 66.1105 (19) (b) 3. of the statutes; relating to:  limits on 5TID creation as measured by total TID value.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nThis bill is explained in the Notes provided by the Joint Legislative Council in the bill.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\n\nJoint Legislative Council prefatory note:  This bill was prepared for the Joint Legislative Council's Study Committee on Review of Tax Incremental Financing.\n\nBackground\n\nAs part of the process of creating a tax incremental district (TID), a city's or village's creation resolution must include a finding that the TID complies with the 12 percent limit.  The 12 percent limit requires that the equalized value of the taxable property in the proposed TID, plus the value increments of all existing TIDs, does not exceed 12 percent of the total equalized value of taxable property in the city or village.  When certifying a base value for a TID, the Department of Revenue (DOR) also evaluates whether the TID exceeds the 12 percent limit.  DOR may not certify the base value until it reviews and approves the city's or village's finding that the equalized value of taxable property in the TID plus the value increment of all existing TIDs does not exceed 12 percent of the total equalized value of taxable property within the city.\n\nA city or village may amend a TID's project plan so that a proposed new, or existing, TID is in compliance if the creation or a new, or project plan amendment of an existing, TID would exceed the 12 percent limit.  If DOR determines that the TID exceeds the 12 percent limit, the city or village may either rescind its approval of the project plan or remove parcels of land so that the TID complies with the 12 percent limit.  If the city or village decides to remove parcels of land, then it must resubmit the creation application to DOR within 30 days of receiving the noncompliance notice.\n\nSection 66.1105, stats., contains several exceptions to the 12 percent limit that apply to specific communities.  Additionally, 2013 Wisconsin Act 193 allows a city or village to create a TID in recently annexed town territory if certain conditions are satisfied.  Under the alternative creation method created by Act 193, the 12 percent limit does not apply to a TID created in former town territory until the year 2016.\n\nThe Bill\n\nUnder this bill, references in s. 66.1105, stats., to the 12 percent limit are generally modified to reflect an increase to a 15 percent limit for the ratio of TID value increments to total equalized value of taxable property in a city or village.  References to the 12 percent limit that relate to exceptions to the rule for specific communities are maintained at 12 percent and amended to reflect the law in place at the time of the creation of each exception.\nSB55,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  66.1105 (4) (gm) 4. c. of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB55,2,132\n66.1105 (4) (gm) 4. c.  Except as provided in subs. (10) (c), (16) (d), (17), and (18) 3(c) 3., the equalized value of taxable property of the district plus the value increment 4of all existing districts does not exceed 12 15 percent of the total equalized value of 5taxable property within the city.  In determining the equalized value of taxable 6property under this subd. 4. c. or sub. (17) (c), the department of revenue shall base 7its calculations on the most recent equalized value of taxable property of the district 8that is reported under s. 70.57 (1m) before the date on which the resolution under 9this paragraph is adopted.  If the department of revenue determines that a local 10legislative body exceeds the 12 percent limit described in this subd. 4. c. or sub.

Also, no TID may be declared distressed or severely distressed if the local government approves a project amendment after October 1, 2009, except for the amendment that declares the TID distressed or severely distressed.\n\nIf a district is designated as a distressed TID, it may collect positive tax increments for up to 10 years after it would otherwise have been required to terminate.  If a district is designated as a severely distressed TID, then it is able to collect positive tax increments for up to 40 years after the district was originally created.\n\nThe Bill\n\nThe bill replaces the October 1, 2015, deadline by which a local government must declare a TID to be distressed or severely distressed with a new deadline of October 1, 2020.\nSB56,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  66.1105 (4e) (a) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB56,2,52\n66.1105 (4e) (a)  Before October 1, 2015 2020, and subject to par.

Referred to Committee on Economic Development and Commerce.\n\nSB57,1,3\n1An Act to amend 66.1105 (2) (aj) and 66.1105 (5) (a); and to create 66.1105 (5) 2(j) of the statutes; relating to: redetermination of base value for tax 3incremental districts.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nThis bill is explained in the Notes provided by the Joint Legislative Council in the bill.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\n\nJoint Legislative Council prefatory note:  This bill was prepared for the Joint Legislative Council's Study Committee on Review of Tax Incremental Financing (TIF).\n\nCurrent law\n\nUnder current law, following the creation of a tax incremental district (TID), the Department of Revenue (DOR) determines the equalized value of the taxable property within the district.  This value is referred to as the TID's \"base value.\"  Typically, during the TID's life span, property values of the property in the TID will rise above the base value, and the portion of taxes collected on the increase in value of property located in the TID will be used to pay back the project costs of the TID.\n\nCurrent law, as affected by 2013 Wisconsin Act 183, addresses the situation where the values of property in a TID do not rise as expected, but instead fall.  Under this act, a local legislative body of a city or village may, subject to joint review board (JRB) approval, request that DOR redetermine the base value of a TID that is in a \"decrement situation\" that continues for at least two consecutive years.  A \"decrement situation\" is defined as a decline in current value of TID property of at least 10 percent compared to the current base value of the TID.  A local legislative body may request redetermination of the base value of a TID in a decrement situation once during the lifespan of the TID, and DOR may impose a fee of $1,000 for the redetermination.  Additionally, before DOR may carry out a redetermination, the local legislative body must conduct a financial analysis of the TID, and must amend the TID project plan to satisfy at least one of the following conditions:\n\n•  With regard to the total value of public infrastructure improvement in the district that occurs after JRB approval, at least 51 percent of the value of the improvements must be financed by a private developer or other private entity in return for the city's or village's agreement to repay those costs solely through the payment of cash grants, and that cash grants must be paid through a development agreement with the city or village.\n\n•  All project costs are expected to be paid within 90 percent of the TID's remaining life.\n\n•  Expenditures may be made only within the first half of the TID's remaining life, unless approved by unanimous vote of the JRB, and subject to the generally applicable limitations or the timing of expenditures under TIF law.\n\n[s. 66.1105 (5) (i), stats.]\n\nThe bill\n\nThe bill proposes an alternative process for redetermining the base value of a TID.  The bill would authorize a local legislative body to request redetermination any time that a TID is in a decrement situation for a single year.  Under the bill, a local legislative body's ability to require redeterminations under the alternative process must first be included in the TID's project plan, resulting in JRB approval of the possibility of redetermination but not each specific resolution for redetermination.  The ability of a local legislative body to request multiple redeterminations also must be specifically stated in the project plan.  Under the bill, the $1,000 fee to DOR would apply to each redetermination.\nSB57,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  66.1105 (2) (aj) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB57,2,62\n66.1105 (2) (aj)  \"Decrement situation\" means a situation in which the 3aggregate value, as equalized by the department of revenue, of all taxable property 4located within a tax incremental district on or about the date on which a resolution 5is adopted under sub.

Taylor, Wachs, Zamarripa and Zepnick. Referred to Committee on Education Reform and Government Operations.\n\nSB58,1,4\n1An Act to repeal 3.002 (2); to consolidate, renumber and amend 3.002 2(intro.) and (1m); to amend 3.004 (2) and 5.15 (4) (a); to repeal and recreate 3subchapter I of chapter 4 [precedes 4.001]; and to create 13.49 of the statutes; 4relating to: legislative and congressional redistricting.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nCurrently, under the state constitution, the legislature is directed to redistrict legislative districts according to the number of inhabitants at its next session following each decennial federal census.  At the same intervals, the legislature also reapportions congressional districts in this state pursuant to federal law.  Under current state law, following each decennial federal census, most municipalities are also required to divide their territory into wards.  With limited exceptions, wards are required to consist of one or more whole, contiguous census blocks (the smallest geographic units for which census results are available).  Traditionally, the legislature has used municipal wards to construct legislative and congressional districts, although the legislature may adjust the boundaries of a municipal ward and use the revised ward boundaries instead.  Legislative and congressional redistricting plans enacted pursuant to this procedure are used to elect members of the legislature and members of Congress in the fall of the second year following the year of the census.\n\nThis bill creates a new procedure for the preparation of legislative and congressional redistricting plans.  The bill directs the Legislative Reference Bureau (LRB) to draw redistricting plans based upon standards specified in the bill and establishes a Redistricting Advisory Commission to perform certain tasks in the redistricting process.  The bill also makes various other changes to the laws governing redistricting.  Significant aspects of the bill include:\n\nRedistricting standards\n\nUnder the bill, a redistricting plan drawn by the LRB must satisfy several criteria, including:\n\n1.  The plan must be based on population requirements imposed under the Wisconsin Constitution and the U.S. Constitution and requirements imposed under Section 2 of the federal Voting Rights Act, which, among other things, generally prohibits redistricting plans from abridging the right to vote on account of race or color or because a person is a member of a language minority group.\n\n2.  The senate and assembly districts established in the plan must satisfy equal population standards specified in the bill.  Among other things, no senate district may have a population which exceeds that of any other senate district by more than 10 percent and no assembly district may have a population which exceeds that of any other assembly district by more than 10 percent, unless necessary to maintain compliance with Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.  Congressional districts established in the plan must each have a population as nearly equal as practicable to the ideal population for such districts, while maintaining compliance with Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.\n\n3.  District boundaries under the plan must coincide with municipal ward boundaries and, to the extent consistent with the Wisconsin Constitution, the U.S. Constitution, and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, must coincide with the boundaries of political subdivisions.  The number of political subdivisions divided among more than one district must be as small as possible and, with limited exceptions, if there is a choice among political subdivisions to divide, the more populous political subdivisions shall be divided before the less populous.\n\n4.  Districts must be composed of convenient contiguous territory.  Under the bill, areas which meet only at the points of adjoining corners are not contiguous.\n\n5.  To the extent consistent with the requirements described in items 1. to 3., districts must be compact.  The bill also specifies how compactness is to be measured.\n\n6.  In preparing the plan, the LRB must be strictly nonpartisan.  No district may be drawn for the purpose of favoring a political party, incumbent legislator or member of Congress, or other person or group, or, except to the extent necessary to meet the requirements described in item 1., for the purpose of augmenting or diluting the voting strength of a language or racial minority group.  The LRB may not use residence addresses of incumbent legislators or members of Congress, political affiliations of registered voters, previous election results, or, except as necessary to meet the requirements described in item 1., demographic information.\n\n7.  The number of assembly districts may not be less than 54 nor more than 100.  The number of senate districts may not be more than one-third nor less than one-fourth of the number of assembly districts.  Each senate district must contain only whole assembly districts and, with certain exceptions, each congressional district may contain only whole senate districts, to the extent possible.\n\nRedistricting Advisory Commission\n\nThe bill assigns several tasks to the Redistricting Advisory Commission, including:\n\n1.  If requested to do so by the LRB, the commission must provide direction to the LRB concerning any decision the LRB must make in preparing a redistricting plan for which no clearly applicable guideline is provided under the bill.\n\n2.  The commission must make available to the public at the earliest feasible time copies of any redistricting bill delivered by the LRB to the legislature, as provided under this bill, maps illustrating the redistricting bill, a summary of the standards applicable to the LRB for development of the plan in the redistricting bill, and a statement of the population of each district created in the plan and the relative deviation of each district population from the ideal district population.\n\n3.  The commission must conduct at least three public hearings on a redistricting bill delivered by the LRB to the legislature, as provided under this bill, unless the redistricting bill represents a plan drawn in response to a redistricting bill that was previously delivered to the legislature and rejected by at least one house.  The commission must submit a report to the legislature summarizing information and testimony received by the commission at the hearings.  The report may also include any comments and conclusions which the commission's members deem appropriate concerning the information and testimony received at the hearings or otherwise presented to the commission.\n\nThe bill also permits the commission to establish policies limiting the information that the LRB may provide to persons outside of LRB staff concerning any redistricting plan drawn by the LRB, except that any such policy does not apply to population data furnished to the LRB by the U.S. Bureau of the Census or to a redistricting plan after a bill embodying that plan is delivered by the LRB to the legislature as required under this bill.\n\nUnder the bill, the Redistricting Advisory Commission must be created not later than February 15 of the first year following the decennial federal census and terminates upon satisfying its duties, until a new Redistricting Advisory Commission is created for the next round of legislative and congressional redistricting.  The commission consists of five members.  The speaker and minority leader of the assembly and the majority and minority leaders of the senate must each appoint one person to serve on the commission.  Within 30 days after the fourth commission member is appointed, but not later than February 15 of the first year following the decennial federal census, the four commission members so appointed must select the fifth commission member, who serves as chairperson.  The bill prohibits all of the following individuals from being a commission member:  individuals who are not eligible electors of this state at the time of the appointment, individuals who hold partisan public office or political party office, and individuals who are a relative of or are employed by a member of the legislature or of Congress, or are employed directly by the legislature or Congress.\n\nRedistricting process\n\nThe bill requires the LRB to perform certain tasks in preparation for drawing congressional and legislative redistricting plans on the basis of each federal decennial census.  For example, as soon as possible after receiving from the U.S. Bureau of the Census the population data needed for legislative redistricting, the LRB must use that data to assign a population figure to geographic or political units to facilitate the drawing of redistricting plans.  Typically, this data is available on or about April 1 of the first year following the decennial federal census.  The LRB must also prepare and publish an analysis describing the population of current legislative and congressional districts and the extent to which the districts may violate the redistricting standards described above.  In addition, as municipalities complete their ward plans (typically, by October of the first year following the decennial federal census), the LRB must assign a population figure based upon certified federal census data to each municipal ward, for use in drawing redistricting plans.\n\nNot later than January 1 of the second year following the decennial federal census, the LRB must deliver to the majority leader of the senate and speaker of the assembly identical bills embodying a plan of legislative and congressional districting, drawn in accordance with the standards described above.  The bill further specifies a procedure that the legislature must follow in considering the bills, although that procedure is not enforceable by the courts.  The bill requires either the assembly or the senate to bring the bill to a vote expeditiously, but not less than seven days after the report of the Redistricting Advisory Commission is received and made available to the members of the legislature.  The vote must be under a procedure or rule permitting no amendments except those of a purely corrective nature.  If the bill is approved by the first house in which it is considered, the bill must expeditiously be brought to a vote in the second house under a similar procedure or rule.\n\nIf neither of the bills delivered by the LRB is approved by both the assembly and the senate, the chief clerk of the house that failed to approve the bill must transmit to the LRB information which that house may direct regarding reasons why the plan was not approved.  The LRB must then prepare identical bills embodying a second plan of legislative and congressional redistricting, taking into account the reasons transmitted to the LRB, insofar as it is possible to do so while complying with the standards described above.  The LRB must deliver the bill to the majority leader of the senate and the speaker of the assembly no later than 21 days after the date of the vote by which the senate or the assembly failed to approve the bill initially submitted.  This second bill must be expeditiously introduced and brought to a vote not less than seven days after the date of introduction, in the same manner as prescribed for the initial bill.\n\nIf the second bill is similarly rejected by at least one house, the same procedure applies, except that the third bill is subject to amendment in the same manner as other bills.\n\nThe bill also provides exceptions to this process to account for variations in the timing of the release of federal census data.\n\nRequired contents of redistricting bills\n\nThe LRB must ensure that each bill embodying a redistricting plan it draws contains specified conventions to apply wherever territory in a plan is described by geographic boundaries.  Also, each such bill must provide that the bill first applies, with respect to regular elections, to offices filled at the next occurring general election and, with respect to special or recall elections, to offices filled or contested on or after the date of the next occurring general election.\n\nChallenge based on population inequality\n\nIf an action is brought challenging a legislative redistricting plan adopted under the procedure established in the bill on the basis of an excessive population variance among senate or assembly districts, the legislature has the burden of justifying any variance in excess of 10 percent between the population of a senate or assembly district and the applicable ideal district population.  If an action is brought challenging a congressional redistricting plan adopted under the procedure established in the bill on the basis of an excessive population variance among congressional districts, the legislature has the burden of justifying any variance in excess of 1 percent between the population of a congressional district and the applicable ideal district population.\n\nFor further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB58,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  3.002 (intro.) and (1m) of the statutes are consolidated, renumbered 23.002 and amended to read:\nSB58,5,6\n33.002  Description of territory.

II is based \nand used in preparing 13congressional and legislative redistricting plans as required under s. 4.005.\nSB58,4\n\n\n1Section \n4.  Subchapter I of chapter 4 [precedes 4.001] of the statutes is repealed 2and recreated to read:\nSB58,6,33\nCHAPTER 4\nSB58,6,44\nsubchapter i\nSB58,6,65\ngeneral provisions\n6and redistricting\nSB58,6,7\n74.001  Definitions.

(1)  The legislative reference bureau 2shall acquire appropriate information, review and evaluate available facilities, and 3develop programs and procedures in preparation for drawing congressional and 4legislative redistricting plans on the basis of each federal decennial census.\nSB58,7,9\n5(2)  By December 1 of the year of the decennial federal census, the legislative 6reference bureau shall obtain from the U.S. bureau of the census information 7regarding geographic and political units in this state for which federal census 8population data has been gathered and will be tabulated.  The legislative reference 9bureau shall use the information to do all of the following:\nSB58,7,1210\n(a)  Prepare necessary descriptions of geographic and political units for which 11census data will be reported and which are suitable for use as components of 12legislative districts.\nSB58,7,1513\n(b)  Prepare maps of geographic and political units within the state which may 14be used to illustrate the locations of district boundaries proposed in plans prepared 15in accordance with s. 4.007.\nSB58,7,25\n16(3)  As soon as possible after receiving from the U.S. bureau of the census the 17population data needed for legislative redistricting which the U.S. bureau of the 18census is required to provide this state under P. L. 94-171, the legislative reference 19bureau shall use that data to assign a population figure based upon certified federal 20census data to each geographic or political unit described under sub. (2) (b).  The 21legislative reference bureau shall prepare and publish an analysis describing the 22population of current legislative and congressional districts and the extent to which 23the districts may violate the standards under s. 4.007.

(1) to (3):\nSB58,9,2520\n(a)  If certified federal census data which is sufficient to permit preparation of 21a congressional redistricting plan becomes available at an earlier time than the 22population data needed to permit preparation of a legislative redistricting plan in 23accordance with s. 4.007, the legislative reference bureau shall so inform the 24majority leader of the senate and the speaker of the assembly.  If the majority leader 25of the senate and the speaker of the assembly jointly direct, the legislative reference 1bureau shall prepare a separate bill establishing congressional districts and deliver 2it separately from the bill establishing legislative districts.  The legislature shall 3proceed to consider the congressional redistricting bill in substantially the manner 4prescribed by subs. (1) to (3).\nSB58,10,145\n(b)  If the population data for legislative redistricting which the U.S. bureau of 6the census is required to provide this state under P.

(1)  Legislative and congressional districts 16shall be established on the basis of population requirements imposed under the 17Wisconsin Constitution and the U.S. Constitution and requirements imposed under 18Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.\nSB58,11,6\n19(2)  Senate and assembly districts, respectively, shall satisfy the population 20standards established in this subsection.  The quotient, obtained by dividing the sum 21of the absolute values of the deviations of all district populations from the applicable 22ideal district population by the number of districts established, may not exceed 1 23percent of the applicable ideal district population, unless necessary to maintain 24compliance with Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.  For purposes of this subsection, 25the ideal district population is determined by dividing the number of districts to be 1established into the population of the state reported in the most recent federal 2decennial census.  No senate district may have a population which exceeds that of 3any other senate district by more than 10 percent and no assembly district may have 4a population which exceeds that of any other assembly district by more than 10 5percent, unless necessary to maintain compliance with Section 2 of the Voting Rights 6Act.\nSB58,11,12\n7(3)  Congressional districts shall each have a population as nearly equal as 8practicable to the ideal district population, derived as prescribed in sub. (2), while 9maintaining compliance with Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.  No congressional 10district may have a population which varies by more than 1 percent from the 11applicable ideal district population, unless necessary to comply with Section 2 of the 12Voting Rights Act.\nSB58,11,20\n13(4)  District boundaries shall coincide with ward boundaries and, to the extent 14consistent with sub. (1), shall coincide with the boundaries of political subdivisions.  15The number of political subdivisions divided among more than one district shall be 16as small as possible.  When there is a choice among political subdivisions to divide, 17the more populous political subdivisions shall be divided before the less populous, 18except that this requirement does not apply to a legislative district boundary drawn 19along a county boundary which passes through a city with territory in more than one 20county.\nSB58,11,22\n21(5)  Districts shall be composed of convenient contiguous territory.  Areas which 22meet only at the points of adjoining corners are not contiguous.\nSB58,11,23\n23(6) (a)  In this subsection:\nSB58,12,724\n1.  \"Geographic unit center\" means that point within a population data unit 25approximately equidistant from the northern and southern extremities and also 1approximately equidistant from the eastern and western extremities of the 2population data unit.  This point shall be determined by visual observation of a map 3of the population data unit, unless it is otherwise determined within the context of 4an appropriate coordinate system developed by the federal government or another 5source that the legislative reference bureau determines is qualified and objective and 6is obtained for use in this state with prior approval of the joint committee on 7legislative organization.\nSB58,12,118\n2.  \"Population data unit\" means a ward, census enumeration district, block, or 9other unit of territory having clearly identified geographic boundaries and for which 10a total population figure is included in or can be derived directly from certified 11federal census data.\nSB58,12,1712\n3.  \"X-coordinate\" means the relative location of a point along the east–west 13axis of the state.  Unless otherwise measured within the context of an appropriate 14coordinate system obtained for use as permitted by subd. 1., the x-coordinate shall 15be measured along a line drawn due east from a due north and south line running 16through the point which is the western extremity of this state, to the point to be 17located.\nSB58,12,2318\n4.  \"Y-coordinate\" means the relative location of a point along the north–south 19axis of the state.  Unless otherwise measured within the context of an appropriate 20coordinate system obtained for use as permitted by subd. 1., the y-coordinate shall 21be measured along a line drawn due south from a due east and west line running 22through the point which is the northern extremity of this state, to the point to be 23located.\nSB58,13,524\n(b)  To the extent consistent with subs. (1) to (3), districts shall be compact in 25form.  Compact districts are those which are square, rectangular, or hexagonal in 1shape to the extent permitted by natural or political boundaries.  When it is 2necessary to compare the relative compactness of 2 or more districts, or of 2 or more 3alternative redistricting plans, the tests prescribed by pars. (c) and (d) shall be used.  4Should the results of these 2 tests be contradictory, the standard under par. (c) shall 5be given greater weight than the standard under par. (d).\n            Down\r\n        Down\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Up\r\n        Up\r\nSB58,13,86\n(c) 1.  The compactness of a district is greatest when the length of the district 7and the width of the district are equal.  The measure of a district's compactness is 8the absolute value of the difference between the length and the width of the district.\nSB58,13,139\n2.  In measuring the compactness of a district by means of electronic data 10processing, the difference between the x-coordinates of the easternmost and the 11westernmost geographic unit centers included in the district shall be compared to the 12difference between the y-coordinates of the northernmost and southernmost 13geographic unit centers included in the district.\nSB58,14,214\n3.  To determine the length and width of a district by manual measurement, the 15distance from the northernmost point or portion of the boundary of a district to the 16southernmost point or portion of the boundary of the same district and the distance 17from the westernmost point or portion of the boundary of the district to the 18easternmost point or portion of the boundary of the same district shall each be 19measured.  If the northernmost or southernmost portion of the boundary, or each of 20these points, is a part of the boundary running due east and west, the line used to 21make the measurement required by this subdivision shall be drawn either due north 22and south or as nearly so as the configuration of the district permits.  If the 23easternmost or westernmost portion of the boundary, or each of these points, is a part 24of the boundary running due north and south, a similar procedure shall be followed.  25The lines to be measured for the purpose of this subdivision shall each be drawn as 1required by this subdivision, even if some part of either or both lines lies outside the 2boundaries of the district which is being tested for compactness.\nSB58,14,83\n4.  The absolute values computed for individual districts under this paragraph 4may be cumulated for all districts in a plan in order to compare the overall 5compactness of 2 or more alternative redistricting plans for the state or for a portion 6of the state.  However, it is not valid to cumulate or compare absolute values 7computed using the measurements under subd. 2. with those computed using the 8measurements under subd. 3.\nSB58,14,119\n(d) 1.  The compactness of a district is greatest when the ratio of the dispersion 10of population about the population center of the district to the dispersion of 11population about the geographic center of the district is one to one.\nSB58,14,2212\n2.  The population dispersion about the population center of a district or about 13the geographic center of a district is computed as the sum of the products of the 14population of each population data unit included in the district multiplied by the 15square of the distance from the geographic unit center of that population data unit 16to the population center or the geographic center of the district, as the case may be.  17The geographic center of the district is defined by averaging the locations of all 18geographic unit centers which are included in the district.  The population center of 19the district is defined by computing the population–weighted average of the 20x-coordinates and y-coordinates of each geographic unit center assigned to the 21district, it being assumed for the purpose of this calculation that each population 22data unit possesses uniform density of population.\nSB58,14,2523\n3.  The ratios computed for individual districts under this paragraph may be 24averaged for all districts in a plan in order to compare the overall compactness of 2 25or more alternative redistricting plans for the state or for a portion of the state.\nSB58,15,6\n1(7)  In preparing any redistricting plan, the legislative reference bureau shall 2be strictly nonpartisan.  No district may be drawn for the purpose of favoring a 3political party, incumbent legislator or member of Congress, or other person or group 4or, except to the extent required under sub. (1), for the purpose of augmenting or 5diluting the voting strength of a language or racial minority group.  In establishing 6districts, no use shall be made of any of the following data:\nSB58,15,77\n(a)  The residence addresses of incumbent legislators or members of Congress.\nSB58,15,88\n(b)  Political affiliations of registered voters.\nSB58,15,99\n(c)  Previous election results.\nSB58,15,1110\n(d)  Demographic information except as necessary to meet the requirements of 11sub. (1).\nSB58,15,20\n12(8)  The number of assembly districts in any redistricting plan may not be less 13than 54 nor more than 100.  The number of senate districts in any redistricting plan 14may not be more than one-third nor less than one-fourth of the number of assembly 15districts.  Each senate district shall contain only whole assembly districts.  Except 16as otherwise provided in this subsection, to the extent possible, each congressional 17district shall contain only whole senate districts.  The other standards specified in 18this section shall take precedence where a conflict arises between those standards 19and the requirement of including only whole senate districts within a congressional 20district.\nSB58,15,22\n214.008  Required provisions in redistricting bills.  Each bill delivered under 22s. 4.006 shall provide all of the following:\nSB58,15,24\n23(1)  That, wherever territory is described in the bill by geographic boundaries, 24the following conventions are used:\nSB58,16,2\n1(a)  Each bound continues to the intersection with the bound next named, or to 2the intersection with a straight-line extension of such bound.\nSB58,16,43\n(b)  If the bound is a street, it follows the center line of the street or the center 4line of the street extended.\nSB58,16,65\n(c)  If the bound is a railroad right-of-way, it follows the center line of the 6railroad right-of-way.\nSB58,16,87\n(d)  If the bound is a river or stream, it follows the center of the main channel 8of such river or stream.\nSB58,16,99\n(e)  If the bound follows a municipal boundary, it coincides with such boundary.\nSB58,16,13\n10(2)  That the bill first applies, with respect to regular elections, to offices filled 11at the next occurring general election after the bill takes effect and, with respect to 12special or recall elections, to offices filled or contested on or after the date of that 13general election.\nSB58,16,24\n144.0085  Challenge based on population inequality; burden of proof.  If 15an action is brought challenging a legislative redistricting plan under this 16subchapter on the basis of an excessive population variance among senate or 17assembly districts established in the plan, the legislature has the burden of 18justifying any variance in excess of 10 percent between the population of a senate or 19assembly district and the applicable ideal district population.  If an action is brought 20challenging a congressional redistricting plan under this subchapter on the basis of 21an excessive population variance among congressional districts established in the 22plan, the legislature has the burden of justifying any variance in excess of 1 percent 23between the population of a congressional district and the applicable ideal district 24population.\nSB58,5\n\n\n25Section \n5.  5.15 (4) (a) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB58,17,19\n15.15 (4) (a)  Except as provided in par. (c), the division ordinance or resolution 2shall number all wards in the municipality with unique whole numbers in 3consecutive order, beginning with the number one, shall designate the polling place 4for each ward, and shall describe the boundaries of each ward consistent with the 5conventions set forth in s. 4.003 4.008 (1).  The ordinance or resolution shall be 6accompanied by a list of the block numbers used by the U.S. bureau of the census that 7are wholly or partly contained within each ward, with any block numbers partly 8contained within a ward identified, and a map of the municipality which illustrates 9the revised ward boundaries.  If the legislature, in an act redistricting legislative 10districts under article IV, section 3, of the constitution, or in redistricting 11congressional districts, establishes a district boundary within a municipality that 12does not coincide with the boundary of a ward established under the ordinance or 13resolution of the municipality, the municipal governing body shall, no later than 14April 10 of the 2nd year following the year of the federal decennial census on which 15the act is based, amend the ordinance or resolution to the extent required to effect 16the act.  The amended ordinance or resolution shall designate the polling place for 17any ward that is created to effect the legislative act.  Nothing in this paragraph shall 18be construed to compel a county or city to alter or redraw supervisory or aldermanic 19districts.\nSB58,6\n\n\n20Section \n6.  13.49 of the statutes is created to read:\nSB58,17,21\n2113.49  Redistricting advisory commission.

Under the bill, a provision in a contract or lease is void if that provision modifies or limits otherwise available necessary or useful procedural or substantive rights of a consumer, borrower, tenant, or employee in a court action or arbitration proceeding to enforce those rights against a party to the contract or lease.\n\nExamples in the bill of provisions that modify or limit otherwise available necessary or useful procedural or substantive rights include provisions that require the consumer, borrower, tenant, or employee to do any of the following:\n\n1.  Assert a claim against the person who prepared the contract or lease in a forum that is not in this state.\n\n2.  Forego access to evidence otherwise obtainable under the rules of procedure of a convenient judicial forum.\n\n3.  Forego the right to appeal a decision that is not based on substantial evidence or that disregards his or her legal rights.\n\n4.

Forego an award of attorney fees, civil penalties, or punitive damages otherwise available by law.\n\n6.  Waive the right of access to a judicial forum or to a jury trial, unless the contract or lease includes judicial review of any arbitration agreement.\n\nThe bill specifies that these provisions do not apply to collective bargaining agreements or to certain contracts of employment for compensation in excess of $100,000 per year.  The bill also permits a party to a contract or lease to seek judicial review of the enforceability of one of these provisions as a preliminary matter in a court action or arbitration proceeding in which such a provision is at issue.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB61,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  134.495 of the statutes is created to read:\nSB61,2,2\n2134.495  Limitations on contract and lease provisions.

Referred to Committee on Health and Human Services.\n\nSB62,1,4\n1An Act to repeal 69.21 (2) (d) 2. and 69.24 (1) (am); to consolidate, renumber 2and amend 69.21 (2) (a) and (c); to amend 69.21 (2) (d) 1. and 69.24 (1) (a); and 3to create 69.30 (3) of the statutes; relating to: copying, making available, and 4required notices on, certain vital records.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nCurrent law contains certain provisions addressing the preparation and issuance of vital records and the authorized copying of vital records.  Vital records include certificates of birth, death, divorce, or annulment, and termination of domestic partnership, marriage documents, and declarations of domestic partnership.  Some of these provisions make a distinction based upon whether the event that is the subject of a record occurred before October 1, 1907.  Current law provides for the issuance of certified and uncertified copies of vital records by the state registrar appointed by the Department of Health Services (state registrar) or a local registrar, subject to various restrictions, and for the issuance of uncertified copies of vital records for events occurring before October 1, 1907, by other persons, such as the State Historical Society.  Certified copies of vital records include a certification including the seal of the issuing officer, are deemed the same as the original vital record, and, with certain exceptions, are regarded as being presumptive evidence of any fact stated in the vital record.  Uncertified copies do not have the same status or certification as certified records and have a notice on their face that they are uncertified.\n\nCurrent law provides that any person who makes available to the public in electronic format an uncertified photocopy of a vital record for an event occurring before October 1, 1907, other than a vital record held by the state registrar or a local registrar, is guilty of a Class I felony.  Current law does not specifically prohibit making any other vital records available to the public in electronic format, but it does provide that, subject to certain exceptions, any person who prepares or issues any paper or film which purports to be, or carries the appearance of, an original or a copy of a vital record, whether certified or uncertified, also is guilty of a Class I felony.\n\nThis bill repeals the prohibition against making certain records for events occurring before October 1, 1907, available in electronic format and specifically provides that any person may copy or make available electronically an uncertified copy of a vital record for an event occurring before October 1, 1907.  In addition, the bill repeals the requirement that uncertified copies of vital records for events occurring before October 1, 1907, contain a notice that they are uncertified.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB62,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  69.21 (2) (a) and (c) of the statutes are consolidated, renumbered 269.21 (2) (a) and amended to read:\nSB62,2,93\n69.21 (2) (a)  The state registrar or local registrar shall issue an uncertified copy 4of the vital record of one or more registrants if the subject of the vital record is an 5event occurring after September 30, 1907.  The requirements of ss. 69.15 (6) (b) and 669.20 (3) (b) for disclosing information under s. 69.20 (2) shall apply to issuance 7under this paragraph of any copy of a vital record containing such information.

Brooks, Katsma and Schraa. Referred to Committee on Revenue, Financial Institutions, and Rural Issues.\n\nSB64,1,4\n1An Act to repeal 66.1105 (5) (i); and to amend 66.1105 (5) (h) 1. of the statutes; 2relating to: changing the conditions under which a city or village may require 3the Department of Revenue to redetermine the value of the tax incremental 4base of a tax incremental district that is in a decrement situation.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nUnder the current tax incremental financing (TIF) program, a city or village may create a tax incremental district (TID) in part of its territory to foster development if at least 50 percent of the area to be included in the TID is blighted, in need of rehabilitation or conservation, suitable for industrial sites, or suitable for mixed-use development.  Currently, towns and counties also have a limited ability to create a TID under certain circumstances.  Before a city or village may create a TID, several steps and plans are required.  These steps and plans include public hearings on the proposed TID within specified time frames, preparation and adoption by the local planning commission of a proposed project plan for the TID, approval of the proposed project plan by the common council or village board, approval of the city's or village's proposed TID by a joint review board (JRB) that consists of members who represent the overlying taxation districts, and adoption of a resolution by the common council or village board that creates the TID as of a date provided in the resolution.\n\nGenerally under current law a local planning commission may amend the project plan of a TID, by adding or subtracting territory from the district, not more than four times during the TID's existence.  If a TID's project plan is amended, current law authorizes the Department of Revenue (DOR) to redetermine the TID's tax incremental base.  DOR may charge a city or village $1,000 to determine or redetermine a TID's tax incremental base or, if a project plan amendment both adds and subtracts territory, DOR may impose a fee of $2,000.\n\nAlso under current law a city or village may adopt a resolution, subject to JRB approval, and not more than once during a TID's life, requiring DOR to redetermine the tax incremental base of a TID that is in a decrement situation that has continued for at least two consecutive years.  Decrement situation is defined as a situation in which the current aggregate equalized value of all the taxable property within the TID is at least 10 percent less than the current value of the TID's tax incremental base.  DOR may charge the city or village $1,000 for the redetermination.\n\nCurrently, before a city or village may adopt a resolution requiring DOR to redetermine the tax incremental base of a TID that is in a decrement situation, the city or village must complete a financial analysis of the TID and must amend the TID's project plan to meet at least one of the following three conditions:\n\n1.  With regard to the total value of public infrastructure improvements in the district that occur after JRB approval, at least 51 percent of the value of the improvements must be financed by a private developer or other private entity in return for the city's or village's agreement to repay those costs solely through the payment of cash grants, and that cash grants must be paid under a development agreement with the city or village.\n\n2.  That all project costs are expected to be paid within 90 percent of the TID's remaining life.\n\n3.  That expenditures may be made only within the first one-half of the TID's remaining life, unless approved by unanimous vote of the JRB, and subject to the generally applicable limitations or the timing of expenditures under TIF law.\n\nUnder this bill, a city or village may adopt a resolution requiring DOR to redetermine the tax incremental base of a TID that is in a decrement situation that has continued for at least two consecutive years without first completing a financial analysis of the TID and without amending the TID's project plan to meet any of the three conditions that are required under current law.\n\nFor further information see the local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB64,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  66.1105 (5) (h) 1. of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB64,3,22\n66.1105 (5) (h) 1.

In an application for a driver school license, the applicant must identify all driver school office and driver school classroom locations.  DOT may promulgate rules relating to driver schools and these rules currently include provisions relating to driver school classrooms.

Any change in address of any driver school office or driver school 17classroom must be reported to and approved by the department.  A driver school may 18maintain driver school classrooms at locations other than the driver school office.  19A driver school may provide driver training instruction by means of the Internet 20instead of, or in addition to, providing instruction at a driver school classroom.\nSB65,4\n\n\n21Section \n4.  343.62 (4) (b) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB65,3,722\n343.62 (4) (b)  Notwithstanding par.

Taylor, Wachs, Young, Zamarripa and Zepnick. Referred to Committee on Health and Human Services.\n\nSB68,1,3\n1An Act to create 49.4713 of the statutes; relating to: premium and 2cost-sharing assistance for health plans through the Medical Assistance 3program.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nCurrently, the Department of Health Services (DHS) administers the Medical Assistance (MA) program, which is a joint federal and state program that provides health services to individuals who have limited financial resources.  Some MA services are provided through programs that operate under a waiver of federal Medicaid laws, including services provided through the BadgerCare Plus (BC+) and BadgerCare Plus Core (BC+ Core) programs.  Certain parents and caretaker relatives and certain childless adults with incomes of not more than 100 percent of the federal poverty line (FPL), before a 5 percent income disregard is applied, are currently eligible for BC + or BC+ Core benefits.\n\nThe federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) creates American health benefit exchanges through which individuals purchase coverage under a qualified health plan, which is health insurance that meets certain criteria under the ACA.  Generally, under the ACA, individuals with household incomes between 100 and 400 percent of the FPL who purchase certain qualified health plans through the American health benefit exchanges (exchanges) qualify for income tax credits to subsidize some of the cost of purchasing the qualified health plan.  Qualified health plans may require cost-sharing, such as deductibles or copayments, and the ACA provides certain individuals who purchase specific plans through an exchange with reductions in cost-sharing.  The ACA also provides financial assistance through an enhanced federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) to states that expand their Medicaid programs.  The enhanced FMAP under the ACA applies to certain newly eligible individuals whose family income level is up to 133 percent of the FPL.\n\nThis bill requires DHS to create a premium assistance program to pay premiums and any cost-sharing amounts to assist eligible parents or caretaker relatives and eligible childless adults in purchasing coverage through a qualified health plan offered through an American health benefit exchange.  Eligible parents or caretaker relatives and eligible childless adults are those who would otherwise be eligible for BC+ or BC+ Core except that their family income exceeds the eligibility requirements for BC+ or BC+ Core but does not exceed 133 percent of the FPL.  The bill also requires that DHS ensure that individuals who become eligible for BC+ or BC+ Core while having coverage under a qualified health plan that is offered by an insurer that also offers a managed care plan for the MA program are allowed to transition from the qualified health plan to the managed care plan.  DHS must also ensure that eligible parents, caretaker relatives, and childless adults are allowed to enroll in qualified health plans throughout the year and not solely during open enrollment periods determined by the federal government.\n\nDHS is required to submit a request for any necessary approval to the federal government to implement the premium assistance program and to qualify for the highest available enhanced FMAP for eligible childless adults, parents, and caretaker relatives in the premium assistance program, childless adults eligible for BC+ Core, and, if considered newly eligible under the ACA, parents and caretaker relatives eligible for BC+.  If DHS does not receive federal approval for the premium assistance program or does not qualify, or ceases to qualify, for an enhanced FMAP, DHS must submit a cost analysis to the Joint Committee on Finance (JCF).  If JCF approves of eliminating the premium assistance program, DHS is not required to implement the premium assistance program.\n\nFor further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB68,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  49.4713 of the statutes is created to read:\nSB68,2,5\n249.4713  Premium assistance program.  \n(1)  Definitions.

Referred to Committee on Judiciary and Public Safety.\n\nSB69,1,2\n1An Act to repeal and recreate 103.465 of the statutes; relating to: restrictive 2covenants in employment and agency relationships.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nCurrent law\n\nCovenants not to compete.  Under current law, a covenant by an employee or agent not to compete with his or her employer or principal during the term of the employment or agency, or after the termination of that employment or agency, within a specified territory and during a specified time (covenant not to compete) is lawful and enforceable only if the restrictions imposed are reasonably necessary for the protection of the employer or principal.  Currently, any covenant not to compete that imposes an unreasonable restraint on an employee or agent is illegal, void, and unenforceable even as to any part of the covenant that would be a reasonable restraint.\n\nThe bill\n\nRestrictive covenants.  This bill repeals current law relating to covenants not to compete and instead creates a new provision relating to restrictive covenants in employment and agency relationships.  Under the bill, \"restrictive covenant\" means an agreement that restricts or prohibits competition by an employee or agent of a business or professional practice during the term, or after the termination, of the employment or agency relationship, but does not include an agreement that does not restrict or prohibit competition by an employee or agent of a business or professional practice, including any of the following:\n\n1.  An agreement restricting or prohibiting an employee or agent from disclosing business or professional information that is valuable and confidential to the employer or principal, but that is not valuable and confidential to a competitor of the employer or principal or useful to the employee, the agent, or a competitor in obtaining a competitive advantage over the employer or principal.\n\n2.  An agreement restricting or prohibiting the solicitation or hiring of an employee or agent who is not privy to valuable and confidential business or professional information of the business or professional practice, who does not have substantial relationships with existing or prospective customers, patients, or clients of the business or professional practice, and who has not received unique, extraordinary, or specialized training provided by the business or professional practice or otherwise obtained as a result of the employment or agency relationship with the business or professional practice.\n\nReasonableness and valid consideration.  Specifically, the bill provides that a restrictive covenant is enforceable if the restrictive covenant is reasonable as to time, area, and line of business and is supported by valid consideration (generally, any payment or other thing of value given in exchange for entering into the restrictive covenant).  The bill requires a court to determine that a restrictive covenant is supported by valid consideration if the court finds that any of the following situations exists:\n\n1.  In the case of a restrictive covenant that was executed at, or within a reasonable time after, the commencement of the employment or agency relationship, that the offer of employment or agency, or of continuation of the employment or agency relationship, was contingent on the execution of the restrictive covenant.\n\n2.  In the case of a restrictive covenant that was executed at or about the time of termination of the employment or agency relationship, that the restrictive covenant was supported by valid consideration acceptable to the employee or agent above and beyond any compensation due the employee or agent and any consideration provided for any other covenants, releases, or promises made by the employee or agent.\n\n3.  In the case of a restrictive covenant that was executed at any other time, that at or about the time of execution of the restrictive covenant the employee or agent received in connection with the execution of the restrictive covenant valid consideration, including a) monetary consideration; b) a bonus or incentive payment; c) additional paid time off; d) access to a bonus or other incentive program or pool through which the employee or agent receives additional compensation; e) continuation of the employment or agency relationship at a rate of pay and benefits that is equal to or greater than the pay and benefits received before the execution of the restrictive covenant, if continuation of the employment or agency relationship is contingent on execution of the restrictive covenant; or f) a promise to provide any payment or other thing of value during the term of the restrictive covenant as specified in a written agreement setting forth the circumstances under which that payment or other thing of value will be provided, including a promise to provide paid leave at the end of the employment relationship (commonly referred to in the business community as \"garden leave\").\n\nLegitimate business interest and reasonable necessity.  The bill also provides that a restrictive covenant is enforceable if the person seeking enforcement of the restrictive covenant proves the existence of a legitimate business interest justifying the restrictive covenant and that the restriction or prohibition on competition specified in the restrictive covenant (restraint) is reasonably necessary to protect that legitimate business interest.\n\nThe bill defines \"legitimate business interest\" to include:  1) a trade secret or any other business or professional information that is valuable and confidential but that does not qualify as a trade secret; 2) substantial relationships with specific existing or prospective customers, patients, or clients; 3) customer, patient, or client goodwill associated with a specific geographic location, a specific marketing or trade area, or an ongoing business or professional practice; or 4) unique, extraordinary, or specialized training provided by a business or professional practice or otherwise obtained as a result of an employment or agency relationship with a business or professional practice.\n\nIn determining whether a restraint is overbroad, overlong, or otherwise not reasonably necessary to protect the legitimate business interests justifying the restrictive covenant and, if so, how to modify the restraint so that the restrictive covenant provides only such restraint as is reasonably necessary to protect those interests, the bill requires a court to consider all of the following:\n\n1.  The duration, scope, and nature of the relationship between the person seeking enforcement of the restrictive covenant and the person against whom enforcement is sought prior to the commencement of the enforcement action.\n\n2.  The duration, scope, and nature of the potential harm to those legitimate business interests that might result from a violation of the restrictive covenant.\n\n3.  Any conduct by the person against whom enforcement of the restrictive covenant is sought, beginning on the date of execution of the restrictive covenant, that is relevant to a determination of the proper duration, scope, and nature of the restraint and to enforcement of the restraint.\n\n4.  Evidence of common practice with respect to the duration, scope, and nature of restraints in the specific industry of the person seeking enforcement of the restrictive covenant.\n\nRebuttable presumptions.  In addition, the bill requires a court, in determining the reasonableness of a restrictive covenant, to apply the following rebuttable presumptions:\n\n1.  In the case of a restrictive covenant that applies after the termination of an employment or agency relationship, that a restraint of six months or less is presumed to be reasonable and a restraint of longer than two years is presumed to be unreasonable.\n\n2.  In the case of a restrictive covenant the consideration for which consists of a promise of garden leave during the term of the restrictive covenant, that the restrictive covenant is presumed to be reasonable.\n\nThird-party beneficiaries, assignees, and successors.  Under the bill, subject to certain conditions, a court may not refuse to enforce a restrictive covenant on the ground that the person seeking enforcement of the restrictive covenant is a third-party beneficiary of the restrictive covenant or is an assignee of or a successor to a party to the restrictive covenant.\n\nEnforcement considerations.  The bill also requires a court, in determining the enforceability of a restrictive covenant, to consider the effect of enforcement of the restrictive covenant on the public health, safety, and welfare and to consider all pertinent legal and equitable defenses, except that the court may not consider any individualized economic or other hardship that might be caused to the person against whom enforcement is sought, unless that person shows that exceptional personal circumstances exist, and the court may consider as a defense to the enforcement of the restrictive covenant the fact that the person seeking enforcement is no longer in business in the area or line of business that is the subject of the action to enforce the restrictive covenant only if the discontinuance of business is not the result of a violation of the restrictive covenant.\n\nConstruction of restrictive covenants.  Moreover, the bill requires a court to construe a restrictive covenant in favor of providing reasonable protection to all legitimate business interests established by the person seeking enforcement of the restrictive covenant and not to employ any rule of contractual interpretation that requires a restrictive covenant to be construed narrowly, against the restraint, or against the drafter of the restrictive covenant.\n\nPublic policy.  Further, the bill prohibits a court from refusing to enforce an otherwise enforceable restrictive covenant on the ground that the restrictive covenant violates public policy unless the court specifically articulates the public policy and finds that the public policy substantially outweighs the policy underlying the bill and the need to protect the legitimate business interests established by the person seeking enforcement of the restraint.\n\nDisputes resolved by agreement.  Additionally, the bill permits parties that reach an agreement resolving a pending or threatened action for enforcement of a restrictive covenant to file that agreement with the court and request the court to adopt the agreement as the resolution of the parties' dispute.  If the court finds that the agreement is reasonable and consistent with the policy underlying the bill, the court may incorporate the terms of the agreement into an order resolving the action.\n\nRemedies; costs and attorney fees.  Finally, the bill provides: 1) that if a court determines that a restrictive covenant is enforceable, the court must enforce the restrictive covenant by any appropriate and effective remedy, including a temporary or permanent injunction (injunctive relief); 2) that the court may not require a party seeking enforcement of a restrictive covenant to post a bond as a condition to obtaining injunctive relief, but may order that party to provide to the party enjoined security against any damages that he or she may sustain by reason of the injunctive relief in an amount that is sufficient to protect his or her interests; 3) that if a restrictive covenant contains a contractual provision authorizing the award of costs and attorney fees, a court must award costs and attorney fees in accordance with that contractual provision; and 4) that, in the absence of a contractual provision authorizing the award of costs and attorney fees, a court may award costs and attorney fees to the prevailing party.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB69,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  103.465 of the statutes is repealed and recreated to read:\nSB69,5,3\n2103.465  Restrictive covenants in employment and agency 3relationships.

This subd. 2. f. includes a promise to 10provide garden leave during the term of the restrictive covenant.\nSB69,8,1611\n3.  That the restrictive covenant was executed at or about the time of 12termination of the employment or agency relationship and that the restrictive 13covenant was supported by valid consideration acceptable to the employee or agent 14above and beyond any compensation due the employee or agent and any 15consideration provided for any other covenants, releases, or promises made by the 16employee or agent.\nSB69,8,2017\n(c)  Legitimate business interest.  In any action for the enforcement of a 18restrictive covenant, a court may enforce the restrictive covenant if the restrictive 19covenant is in writing and signed by the person against whom enforcement is sought 20and the person seeking enforcement proves all of the following:\nSB69,8,2321\n1.  The existence of one or more legitimate business interests justifying the 22restrictive covenant.  Any restrictive covenant not supported by a legitimate 23business interest is illegal, void, and unenforceable.\nSB69,9,824\n2.  That the restraint specified in the restrictive covenant is reasonably 25necessary to protect the legitimate business interest justifying the restrictive 1covenant.  If the person seeking enforcement of the restrictive covenant establishes 2a prima facie case that the restraint is reasonably necessary, the person against 3whom enforcement is sought has the burden of establishing that the restraint is 4overbroad, overlong, or otherwise not reasonably necessary to protect the legitimate 5business interest established by the person seeking enforcement.  If the restraint is 6overbroad, overlong, or otherwise not reasonably necessary to protect the legitimate 7business interest, the court shall modify the restraint and grant only such relief as 8is reasonably necessary to protect that legitimate business interest.\nSB69,9,149\n(d)  Determination of reasonable necessity of restraint.  In determining whether 10a restraint specified in a restrictive covenant is overbroad, overlong, or otherwise not 11reasonably necessary to protect the legitimate business interests justifying the 12restrictive covenant and, if so, how to modify the restraint so that the restrictive 13covenant provides only such restraint as is reasonably necessary to protect those 14interests, a court shall consider all of the following:\nSB69,9,1715\n1.  The duration, scope, and nature of the relationship between the person 16seeking enforcement of the restrictive covenant and the person against whom 17enforcement is sought prior to the commencement of the enforcement action.\nSB69,9,1918\n2.  The duration, scope, and nature of the potential harm to those legitimate 19business interests that might result from a violation of the restrictive covenant.\nSB69,9,2320\n3.  Any conduct by the person against whom enforcement of the restrictive 21covenant is sought, beginning on the date of execution of the restrictive covenant, 22that is relevant to a determination of the proper duration, scope, and nature of the 23restraint and to enforcement of the restraint.\nSB69,10,3\n14.  Evidence of common practice with respect to the duration, scope, and nature 2of restraints in the specific industry of the person seeking enforcement of the 3restrictive covenant.\nSB69,10,54\n(e)  Rebuttable presumptions.  In determining the reasonableness of a 5restrictive covenant, a court shall apply the following rebuttable presumptions:\nSB69,10,136\n1.  In the case of a posttermination restrictive covenant, the court shall presume 7a restraint of 6 months or less from the termination of the employment or agency 8relationship to be reasonable and a restraint of longer than 2 years from the 9termination of the employment or agency relationship to be unreasonable.  This 10subdivision does not preclude a court from finding that a restraint of longer than 2 11years from the termination of the employment or agency relationship is reasonable 12if the court determines that clear and convincing evidence exists to support that 13finding.\nSB69,10,1914\n2.  In the case of a restrictive covenant the consideration for which consists of 15a promise described in par. (b) 2. f., the court shall presume that restrictive covenant 16to be reasonable.  This subdivision does not preclude a court from finding that a 17restrictive covenant the consideration for which consists of a promise described in 18par. (b) 2. f. is unreasonable if the court determines that clear and convincing 19evidence exists to support that finding.\nSB69,10,2420\n(f)  Third-party beneficiaries, assignees, and successors.  A court may not refuse 21to enforce a restrictive covenant on the ground that the person seeking enforcement 22of the restrictive covenant is a 3rd-party beneficiary of the restrictive covenant or 23is an assignee of or a successor to a party to the restrictive covenant if any of the 24following apply:\nSB69,11,4\n11.  In the case of a 3rd-party beneficiary of the restrictive covenant, the 2restrictive covenant expressly identifies the person as a 3rd-party beneficiary of the 3restrictive covenant and expressly states that the restrictive covenant is intended for 4the benefit of that person.\nSB69,11,75\n2.  In the case of an assignee of or a successor to a party to the restrictive 6covenant, the restrictive covenant expressly authorizes an assignee of or successor 7to the party to enforce the restrictive covenant.\nSB69,11,118\n(g)  Considerations in enforcing restrictive covenants.  In determining the 9enforceability of a restrictive covenant, a court shall consider the effect of 10enforcement of the restrictive covenant on the public health, safety, and welfare and 11shall consider all pertinent legal and equitable defenses, except as follows;\nSB69,11,1412\n1.  The court may not consider any individualized economic or other hardship 13that might be caused to the person against whom enforcement is sought unless that 14person shows that exceptional personal circumstances exist.\nSB69,11,1915\n2.  The court may consider as a defense to the enforcement of the restrictive 16covenant the fact that the person seeking enforcement is no longer in business in the 17area or line of business that is the subject of the action to enforce the restrictive 18covenant only if the discontinuance of business is not the result of a violation of the 19restrictive covenant.\nSB69,11,2520\n(h)  Construction of restrictive covenants.  A court shall construe a restrictive 21covenant in favor of providing reasonable protection to all legitimate business 22interests established by the person seeking enforcement of the restrictive covenant.  23A court may not employ any rule of contractual interpretation that requires a 24restrictive covenant to be construed narrowly, against the restraint, or against the 25drafter of the restrictive covenant.\nSB69,12,6\n1(i)  Public policy.  No court may refuse to enforce an otherwise enforceable 2restrictive covenant on the ground that the restrictive covenant violates public policy 3unless the court specifically articulates the public policy and finds that the public 4policy substantially outweighs the policy underlying this section and the need to 5protect the legitimate business interests established by the person seeking 6enforcement of the restraint.\nSB69,12,147\n(j)  Dispute resolved by agreement.  If the parties to a pending or threatened 8action for enforcement of a restrictive covenant reach an agreement resolving that 9action, the parties may file that agreement with the court and request the court to 10adopt the agreement as the resolution of the parties' dispute.  If the court finds that 11the agreement is reasonable and consistent with the policy underlying this section, 12the court may incorporate the terms of the agreement into an order resolving the 13action.  If any party is subsequently in violation of the order, any other party may 14commence an action for enforcement of the order.\n            Down\r\n        Down\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Up\r\n        Up\r\nSB69,12,1915\n(k)  Remedies.  1.  If a court determines that a restrictive covenant is 16enforceable, the court shall enforce the restrictive covenant by any appropriate and 17effective remedy, including a temporary or permanent injunction.  Violation of an 18enforceable restrictive covenant creates a presumption of irreparable injury to the 19person seeking enforcement of the restrictive covenant.\nSB69,13,220\n2.  Notwithstanding s. 813.06, the court may not require a party seeking 21enforcement of a restrictive covenant to post a bond as a condition to obtaining the 22injunctive relief specified in subd. 1.  The court may, however, as a condition of 23granting such injunctive relief, order the party seeking that relief to provide to the 24party enjoined security against any damages that the party enjoined may sustain by 1reason of the injunctive relief in an amount that is sufficient to protect the interests 2of the party enjoined.\nSB69,13,43\n3.  The rights and remedies provided under this section are in addition to, and 4do not displace, any other rights and remedies that may exist at law or in equity.\nSB69,13,125\n(L)  Costs and attorney fees.  If a restrictive covenant contains a contractual 6provision authorizing the award of costs and attorney fees to the prevailing party in 7an action seeking enforcement of, or challenging the enforceability of, a restrictive 8covenant, a court shall award costs and attorney fees in accordance with that 9contractual provision.  If a restrictive covenant does not contain such a contractual 10provision, a court may award costs and attorney fees to the prevailing party.  A court 11may not enforce any contractual provision limiting the court's authority under this 12paragraph.\nSB69,13,15\n13(3)  Illegal restraints of trade.  Nothing is this section shall be construed or 14interpreted to legalize or make enforceable any restraint of trade or commerce that 15is otherwise illegal or unenforceable under s. 133.03 or any similar federal law.\nSB69,2\n\n\n16Section \n2.\nInitial applicability.\nSB69,13,2017\n(1)  Restrictive covenants in employment and agency relationships.  This act 18first applies to a restrictive covenant, as defined in section 103.465 (1) (e) of the 19statues, as repealed and recreated by this act, entered into or extended, modified, or 20renewed on the effective date of this subsection.\nSB69,13,2121\n(End)\n            Down\r\n        Down\r\n\r\n    \r\n"

Current law exempts from this prohibition a law enforcement officer acting in his or her official capacity.  This bill also exempts from this prohibition qualified law enforcement officers, without regard to whether they are on duty, and qualified former law enforcement officers to restore the law as it existed prior to 2011 Wisconsin Act 35, commonly known as the Concealed Carry Act.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB70,1\n\n\n6Section \n1.  948.605 (1) (ag) and (ar) of the statutes are created to read:\nSB70,1,77\n948.605 (1) (ag)  \"Former officer\" has the meaning given in s. 941.23 (1) (c).\nSB70,2,2\n1(ar)  \"Qualified out-of-state law enforcement officer\" has the meaning given in 2s. 941.23 (1) (g).\nSB70,2\n\n\n3Section \n2.  948.605 (2) (b) 2d. of the statutes is created to read:\nSB70,2,64\n948.605 (2) (b) 2d.

In addition, a municipality may provide, by adopting a resolution, that an inspector's registration duties may be performed by special registration deputies appointed by the municipal clerk or board of election commissioners.\n\nUnder this bill, an inspector's registration duties may be performed by the municipal clerk, if the clerk is not a candidate listed on the ballot, or by special registration deputies appointed by the municipal clerk or board of election commissioners, without the municipality first adopting a resolution to allow the procedure.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB71,1\n\n\n3Section \n1.  6.55 (6) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB71,2,94\n6.55 (6)  The governing body or board of election commissioners of any 5municipality may provide by resolution that any Any of the registration duties of 1inspectors under sub.

Taylor, Ohnstad, Spreitzer, Wachs, Goyke, Stuck, Kahl and Bowen. Referred to Committee on Natural Resources and Energy.\n\nSB72,1,10\n1An Act to repeal 281.34 (1) (f) and 281.34 (9); to renumber 160.50 (2); to 2renumber and amend 281.34 (5m) and 281.34 (7); to amend 20.370 (6) (eg), 3281.34 (4) (a) 3., 281.34 (5) (a), 281.34 (5) (b) 1. and 2., 281.34 (5) (c), 281.34 (5) 4(d), 281.34 (7) (title), 281.344 (4s) (dm), 281.344 (4s) (dm), 281.346 (4s) (dm), 5281.346 (4s) (dm), 281.346 (12) (a), 281.346 (12) (b), 281.348 (3) (cm) and 6281.348 (3) (cm); and to create 160.50 (2) (b), 281.34 (1) (er), 281.34 (2s), 281.34 7(5) (ds), 281.34 (5) (e) 3., 281.34 (7) (a), 281.34 (7) (b) 1. to 5., 281.34 (7) (c), 8281.341 and 281.346 (8) (cm) of the statutes; relating to: groundwater 9management, approval of high capacity wells, and granting rule-making 10authority.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nGroundwater management areas\n\nDesignation\n\nThis bill establishes standards and a process for designating areas in this state as groundwater management areas.  The standards vary depending on whether an area has a confined aquifer or an unconfined aquifer.  An aquifer is a water-bearing geologic formation.  A confined aquifer has above it a layer (of rock, for example) through which water does not pass easily.  An unconfined aquifer does not have such a layer above it.\n\nThe standards for designating an area with a confined aquifer as a groundwater management area are related to effects that groundwater pumping has in reducing the level to which water would rise in an open well or in reducing the water level in wells pumping from the aquifer.  The standards for designating an area with an unconfined aquifer as a groundwater management area are related to reductions in stream flows caused by pumping and to declines in water tables.\n\nCurrent law provides for a Groundwater Coordinating Council (GCC), consisting of the secretaries of agriculture, trade and consumer protection, natural resources, commerce, and transportation, and the president of the University of Wisconsin System, or their designees; the state geologist; and a person to represent the governor.  This bill requires the GCC to appoint a subcommittee on groundwater area review (council subcommittee), consisting of individuals with technical expertise in the area of groundwater science and management.\n\nThis bill requires the council subcommittee to examine areas that may qualify for designation as groundwater management areas and to forward its conclusions to the GCC.  The council subcommittee must first consider three specific areas for possible designation as groundwater management areas: one area in and adjacent to Brown County; one area in and adjacent to Waukesha County; and the area known as the central sands region.  A person may petition the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) for an area to be designated as a groundwater management area, which the council subcommittee must then consider.  If the council subcommittee forwards a conclusion that an area qualifies as a groundwater management area and the GCC agrees with that conclusion, the GCC may recommend that DNR designate the area as a groundwater management area.  If DNR receives such a recommendation from the GCC, DNR may, by rule, designate the area as a groundwater management area.\n\nAfter DNR promulgates a rule designating an area as a groundwater management area, it must establish a date by which it is reasonable to expect that groundwater conditions in the area will improve to the point that the area will no longer qualify as a groundwater management area (a target date), and conditions to balance groundwater consumption and groundwater replenishment so that there are no significant adverse environmental impacts to surface water or groundwater (sustainable hydrologic conditions).\n\nPlanning\n\nThis bill requires DNR to develop and adopt a groundwater management plan for the groundwater management area.  The groundwater management plan must be designed to protect surface water and groundwater and to ensure that by the target date the area no longer qualifies as a groundwater management area.  The groundwater management plan must contain measurable goals, requirements for reporting to DNR, water conservation measures, and any other provision that DNR determines is necessary to meet the sustainable hydrologic conditions.\n\nIn preparing the groundwater management plan, DNR must appoint and consult with a technical advisory committee and a citizens advisory committee.  The members of the technical advisory committee must have technical expertise in the area of groundwater science and management, and the members of the citizens advisory committee must represent a variety of interested parties in the groundwater management area, including municipal, agricultural, industrial, and commercial water users and conservation groups.\n\nRescinding designation\n\nAfter the target date established by DNR for a groundwater management area, the bill requires the council subcommittee to consider whether the area still qualifies as a groundwater management area.  If the council subcommittee concludes that the area no longer qualifies as a groundwater management area, it must forward that conclusion to the GCC.  If the GCC agrees that the area no longer qualifies as a groundwater management area, the GCC may recommend that DNR rescind the designation.  If the GCC makes that recommendation, DNR may rescind the designation by repealing the rule designating the area as a groundwater management area.\n\nHigh capacity wells\n\nEnvironmental review of proposed high capacity wells\n\nUnder current law, a person may not construct a high capacity well without an approval from DNR.  A high capacity well is a well that, together with all other wells on the same property, has the capacity to withdraw more than 100,000 gallons of water per day.\n\nThis bill requires an applicant for approval of a high capacity well to publish a notice of the application in a newspaper, identifying the owner and the location of the well.\n\nCurrent law requires DNR to conduct an environmental review of applications for approval of a high capacity well that is located in an area within 1,200 feet of a trout stream or exceptional resource waters (a groundwater protection area); a high capacity well with a high water loss, in which less than 5 percent of the water withdrawn is returned after use to the basin from which it is withdrawn; and a high capacity well that may have a significant adverse impact on a qualifying spring.\n\nThis bill eliminates the environmental review requirement relating to springs, and instead requires DNR to conduct an environmental review of an application for approval of a high capacity well that may have a significant adverse impact on waters of the state.\n\nUnder current law, if DNR determines, while conducting an environmental review of a proposed well that meets one of the criteria listed above, that an environmental impact report must be conducted for the proposed well, DNR must generally include conditions in the well approval to ensure that it does not cause significant adverse environmental impact.  If it is not possible to ensure that, DNR must deny the application.  If a proposed well will be used to provide a public water supply and DNR determines that there is no reasonable alternative location for the well, DNR must include in the approval conditions to ensure that the environmental impact of the well is balanced by the public benefit of the well.  Examples of such conditions include conditions relating to the location, depth, pumping capacity, rate of flow, and ultimate use of the well.\n\nThis bill includes monitoring as one of the examples of potential conditions that may be included in such an approval.  This bill also provides that, in any high capacity well approval, DNR may require the well owner to implement a monitoring program to evaluate the impacts of the well, and may modify the approval based on the results of that monitoring program.\n\nCurrent law provides that a high capacity well approval, or application for approval, cannot be challenged based on DNR's lack of consideration of the cumulative impacts of the proposed well and existing wells.  This bill requires DNR, when considering whether a high capacity well may have a significant adverse environmental impact on waters of the state, to consider the cumulative impacts of that high capacity well together with existing withdrawals.\n\nUnder current law, a high capacity well approval generally remains in effect indefinitely, unless modified or rescinded by DNR.  This bill provides that an approval issued after the effective date of the bill may not remain in effect for more than ten years.  An approval issued prior to the effective date of the bill remains in effect for a longer period, depending on how long before the effective date of the bill it was issued.\n\nHigh capacity wells in groundwater management areas\n\nUnder this bill, after DNR develops a groundwater management plan for a groundwater management area, DNR may not approve a high capacity well in the groundwater management area unless the high capacity well is consistent with the groundwater management plan.\n\nThis bill also requires DNR, after it develops a groundwater management plan, to review approvals for high capacity wells in the groundwater management area that were issued before the plan went into effect.  The bill authorizes DNR to modify such approvals to ensure that they are consistent with the groundwater management plan.\n\nFees for certain withdrawals\n\nCurrent law imposes an annual fee of $125 on a person whose water supply system has the capacity to withdraw an average of 100,000 gallons per day in any 30-day period from the waters of the state.  This bill increases that annual fee to $250.\n\nDNR has also established, by rule, water use fees for users who withdraw more than 50,000,000 gallons per year from the Great Lakes basin.  This bill directs DNR to establish such fees for users who withdraw more than 50,000,000 gallons per year from the waters of the state.\n\nOther provisions\n\nThis bill also requires DNR to include water conservation requirements in the approvals, required under current law, for certain surface water withdrawals, if the withdrawal is in a groundwater management area, and requires those conservation requirements to be consistent with the groundwater management plan for the groundwater management area.\n\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB72,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  20.370 (6) (eg) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB72,5,52\n20.370 (6) (eg)  Groundwater mitigation and local assistance.

Brooks, R. Brooks, Danou, Doyle, Edming, Gannon, Jagler, Jarchow, Katsma, Kerkman, Kleefisch, Knodl, Kremer, Krug, Macco, Milroy, Murphy, Murtha, Ohnstad, A. Ott, Ripp, Rohrkaste, Schraa and Weatherston. Referred to Committee on Elections and Local Government.\n\nSB73,1,5\n1An Act to repeal 59.43 (2) (i), 59.43 (2m) (d) 2. and 867.045 (3); and to amend 259.43 (1) (a), 59.43 (1) (L), 59.43 (1) (n), 59.43 (2) (a) 2., 59.43 (2m) (b) 5., 59.43 3(2m) (d) 3., 59.43 (9) (a) 1. g., 236.25 (4), 236.34 (2) (a), 236.45 (2) (am) (intro.), 4703.11 (1) and 779.97 (5) (a) and (b) of the statutes; relating to:  instruments 5filed or recorded with, and fees charged by, the register of deeds.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nCurrent law requires the register of deeds to record and file plats and certified survey maps that are authorized to be filed with the register of deeds.  This bill states that the register of deeds may either record or file these plats and certified survey maps.\n\nAlso under current law, the register of deeds is required to file all documents pertaining to security interests that are authorized to be filed with the register of deeds.  Under this bill, the register of deeds must record these documents.\n\nCurrent law requires the register of deeds to index certain statements or documents upon the filing of certain statements or documents evidencing the creation of a security interest.  Under this bill, these statements and documents must be indexed upon recording.\n\nCurrent law requires the register of deeds to maintain a real estate records index that contains certain specified information.  One item of information required under current law is the volume and page where the recorded instrument is recorded.  Under this bill, the index must provide a document number where the instrument is recorded and the volume and page only in certain situations.\n\nCurrent law requires the filing and indexing of notices of liens on real property for obligations payable to the United States, and certificates and notices affecting the liens, in the office of the register of deeds of the county in which real property subject to the liens is located.  Under current law, the register of deeds may charge a fee for filing and indexing each notice of lien, certificate, or notice, and must bill the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on a monthly basis for fees for documents filed by the IRS.  This bill permits the register of deeds to file a fee for recording or filing each notice of lien, certificate, or notice, and permits, but does not require, the register of deeds to bill IRS on a monthly basis.\n\nUnder current law, counties collect fees for recording or filing instruments that are recorded or filed with a register of deeds.  The general fee for filing or recording instruments is $30.  Among the fees for which a different amount is specified, counties collect $25 for recording certain certificates and for preparing and mailing to the clerk of courts certain documents related to certain survivorship interests in property.  Under this bill, the specification of a different fee for recording instruments related to certain survivorship interests in property is eliminated and the general fee for filing or recording instruments applies.  A requirement that the register of deeds mail to the clerk of courts certain documents related to certain survivorship interests in property is eliminated.\n\nCurrent law specifies certain standard format requirements for documents that are to be recorded with the register of deeds.  Under one of these requirements, a document that is filed with the register of deeds must generally use only black or red ink.  Under this bill, blue ink may also be used.\n\nAlso under current law, the standard format requirements do not apply to instruments that are filed documents.  Under this bill the standard format requirement also does not apply to recorded documents.\n\nUnder current law, one provision of the statutes requires that an instrument that is submitted for recording with the register of deeds contain a blank space at least 2.5 inches by 2.5 inches for use by the register of deeds.  Another provision requires a blank space at least 3 inches by 3 inches.  This bill amends the former provision so that both provisions require a blank space at least 3 inches by 3 inches.\n\nUnder current law, the register of deeds is required to keep certain recorded plats and certified survey maps in volumes or books, which must be kept in the register of deeds office.  Under the bill, a register of deeds may store such documents electronically.\n\nFor further information see the local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB73,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  59.43 (1) (a) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB73,3,22\n159.43 (1) (a)  Record or cause to be recorded in suitable books to be kept in his 2or her office, correctly and legibly all deeds, mortgages, instruments\n, and writings 3authorized by law to be recorded in his or her office and left with him or her for that 4purpose, provided such the documents have plainly printed or typewritten thereon 5on the document the names of the grantors, grantees, witnesses, and notary.  The 6register of deeds shall record and or file or cause to be recorded and or filed all plats 7and certified survey maps that are authorized to be accepted for recording and or 8filing in his or her office.  Any county, by a resolution duly adopted by the board, may 9combine the separate books or volumes for deeds, mortgages, miscellaneous 10instruments, attachments, lis pendens, sales and notices, certificates of organization 11of corporations, plats, or other recorded or filed instruments or classes of documents 12as long as separate indexes may be produced.  Notwithstanding any other provisions 13of the statutes, any county adopting a system of microfilming or like process or a 14system of recording documents by optical imaging or electronic formatting under ch. 15228 may substitute the headings, reel, disk, or electronic file name and microfilm 16image (frame) for volume and page where recorded and different classes of 17instruments may be recorded, reproduced, or copied on or transferred to the same 18reel, disk, or electronic file or part of a reel or disk.

Ott and Spiros. Referred to Committee on Judiciary and Public Safety.\n\nSB75,1,3\n1An Act to create 173.29, 938.3416, 941.293, 971.17 (1i) and 973.0336 of the 2statutes; relating to: possession of dogs by certain felony offenders and 3providing a penalty.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nCurrent law prohibits a person from possessing a firearm if he or she is a felony offender.  A person is a felony offender if any of the following applies:  1) he or she has been found guilty of a felony; 2) he or she has been adjudicated delinquent as a juvenile for an act that would have been a felony if it had been committed by an adult; or 3) he or she has been found not guilty of a felony by reason of mental disease, defect, or illness.  If a felony offender violates the prohibition against possessing a firearm, he or she may be fined not more than $25,000 or imprisoned for not more than ten years, or both.\n\nThis bill prohibits, for a specified period, certain felony offenders from possessing, controlling, or residing with a vicious dog, as determined by a humane officer or a law enforcement officer using criteria specified in the bill.  The prohibition applies to a person whose status as a felony offender is based on the commission of an act that is classified under the bill as a serious felony (serious felony offender).  A serious felony offender who violates the prohibition may be fined up to $10,000 or imprisoned for up to nine months, or both.  If a serious felony offender violates the prohibition and a person or an animal suffers great bodily harm or death due to the violation, the serious felony offender may be fined up to $10,000 or imprisoned for up to three years and six months, or both.  If a serious felony offender violates the and a person suffers great bodily harm or death due to the violation and the serious felony offender knowingly allowed the dog to run loose or failed to take steps to control the dog, the serious felony offender may be fined up to $10,000 or imprisoned for up to six years, or both.\n\nUnless the serious felony offender is on extended supervision or another supervised status (extended supervision), the prohibition applies to the serious felony offender for a period of ten years following:  1) any period of incarceration for the serious felony; 2) the conviction for the serious felony if the sentence does not include a period of incarceration; 3) the delinquency adjudication for the serious felony; or 4) the finding of not guilty of the serious felony by reason of insanity or mental disease, defect, or illness.  If the serious felony offender is on extended supervision, the prohibition period applies until he or she is no longer on extended supervision.\n\nUnder this bill, a serious felony offender may request an exemption from the prohibition if the exemption is reasonably needed to earn a livelihood or as a condition of employment and will not endanger public safety.  A serious felony offender seeking an exemption must file a motion in the circuit court for the county in which he or she will possess, control, or reside with the vicious dog.  The serious felony offender must provide a copy of the motion to the district attorney for that county, who must in turn make a reasonable attempt to contact local law enforcement agencies to inform them of the request and to solicit any information that may be relevant to whether the request should be granted.\n\nBecause this bill creates a new crime or revises a penalty for an existing crime, the Joint Review Committee on Criminal Penalties may be requested to prepare a report concerning the proposed penalty and the costs or savings that are likely to result if the bill is enacted.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB75,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  173.29 of the statutes is created to read:\nSB75,2,5\n2173.29  Vicious dogs.

To be eligible for participation in the venison donation program, the county must accept deer carcasses for processing, it must pay the costs of the processing, and it must make reasonable efforts to donate the venison to a food distribution service or a charitable organization.  Another eligibility requirement is that the county must participate in the wildlife damage abatement program and the wildlife damage claim program (wildlife damage programs).  The wildlife damage programs reimburse a county for certain costs incurred for providing abatement assistance or for paying damage claims with respect to wildlife damage that occurs in the county.  The venison donation program is funded in part by a wildlife damage surcharge on, and by voluntary contributions paid by persons who purchase, certain hunting approvals.\n\nThis bill expands the venison donation program to include wild turkey.  Under the bill, a county is eligible to receive reimbursement for the costs incurred in processing and donating wild turkey, as well as the costs incurred in processing and donating venison, if the county accepts deer or wild turkey carcasses for processing and meets the other eligibility requirements for participation in the program.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB79,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  20.370 (5) (fs) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB79,2,62\n20.370 (5) (fs)  Venison and wild turkey processing.

For vehicles carrying certain commodities or being used to perform certain services, local highway authorities may set different weight limitations or exempt the vehicles from the special or seasonal weight limitations if an exemption or limitation is in the interest of public health, safety and welfare.\n\nAlso under current law, local authorities may designate highways under their jurisdiction as class \"B\" highways.  With limited exceptions, the maximum gross weight and per-axle vehicle weight for vehicles on a class \"B\" highway is 60 percent of the weight allowed by statute if the vehicle were operating on a highway that is not designated as a class \"B\" highway.\n\nThis bill provides that special or seasonal weight limitations imposed by a highway authority and class \"B\" highway weight limitations do not apply to vehicles of public utilities, telecommunications providers, or certain cooperative associations, when the vehicles are being operated for the purpose of responding to service interruptions.\n\nUnder current law, if any bill introduced in either house of the legislature directly or indirectly establishes an exception to vehicle weight limitations, the Department of Transportation (DOT) must prepare a report, containing specified information, relating to the bill within six weeks after the bill in introduced and before any vote is taken on the bill.  This bill directs DOT not to prepare such a report on this bill.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB80,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  348.16 (3) of the statutes is renumbered 348.16 (3) (a).\nSB80,2\n\n\n2Section \n2.  348.16 (3) (b) of the statutes is created to read:\nSB80,2,73\n348.16 (3) (b) Subsection (2) does not apply to a vehicle of a public utility, as 4defined in s. 196.01 (5), a telecommunications provider, as defined in s. 196.01 (8p), 5or a cooperative association organized under ch. 185 for the purpose of producing or 6furnishing heat, light, power, or water to its members, that is being operated for the 7purpose of responding to a service interruption.\nSB80,3\n\n\n8Section \n3.  349.16 (3) of the statutes is renumbered 349.16 (3) (a) and amended 9to read:\nSB80,2,1710\n349.16 (3) (a)  The authority in charge of the maintenance of the highway may 11exempt vehicles carrying certain commodities specified by the authority or which are 12used to perform certain services specified by the authority from the special weight 13limitations which are imposed under sub.

A city or village may regulate professions under its home rule authority and a town or county may regulate professions that they are specifically authorized to regulate.  The authority of a political subdivision to regulate a particular profession may be prohibited or limited by a state statute.\n\nUnder this bill, and subject to an exception, beginning on the effective date of the bill a political subdivision may not impose any occupational fees or licensing requirements on any profession if that profession is not subject to such locally imposed fees and licensing requirements on that date, although a political subdivision may continue to impose fees and licensing requirements on any profession that is already subject to such requirements of the political subdivision.  Under an exception contained in the bill, if a political subdivision imposes an occupational fee or licensing requirement on photographers on the effective date of the bill, that regulation does not apply and may not be enforced.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB81,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  66.0408 of the statutes is created to read:\nSB81,2,3\n266.0408  Regulation of occupations.

relating to: criminal procedure and providing penalties.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nThis bill reorganizes each chapter of the criminal procedure code, with the exception of chapter 973, Sentencing.  This analysis is organized in the ascending order of the chapters, as reorganized in the bill.  This bill creates subchapters in long chapters, separates long statutes into shorter statutes, reorganizes individual statutes, and provides titles for some provisions.  This bill also creates new authority for courts and codifies some current practices.\n\nUnder this bill, chapter 967 contains definitions of terms used throughout the criminal procedure code and general provisions that, under current law, appear throughout the criminal procedure code.  The bill also adds definitions for certain terms including \"complaint,\" \"district attorney,\" \"felony,\" \"misdemeanor,\" \"motion,\" and \"sentencing.\"\n\nThis bill moves to chapter 968 all current law provisions relating to investigative procedures such as inquests, John Doe proceedings, grand juries, wiretapping, and search and seizure provisions.\n\nThis bill creates a process that requires a court, upon the request of a district attorney and a showing that the information requested is relevant to a criminal investigation, to order a financial institution to disclose to the district attorney whether a specified person has or had an account at the financial institution.\n\nChapter 969, as reorganized under this bill, contains provisions addressing arrest and release, identifies ways to secure the appearance of a defendant, and includes provisions that allow expediting the processing of misdemeanors.  Under current law, a citation issued by a law enforcement officer directs a person to appear in court and answer criminal charges.  The citation may not be used as a criminal complaint.  This bill allows a citation for a misdemeanor that is issued by a law enforcement officer to be used as a criminal complaint if the district attorney endorses it.  The bill specifies that a citation must contain the crime the person allegedly committed, the time and place of the alleged commission, and the maximum penalty for the charged crime.  The bill requires a law enforcement officer citing a person for a misdemeanor to release the person without a cash bond unless certain circumstances apply, including if the person does not provide proper identification or appears to pose a danger to a person or property.\n\nUnder current law, a law enforcement officer generally may release a person who is arrested without a warrant without requiring the person to appear before a judge if the law enforcement officer is satisfied that there are insufficient grounds to issue a criminal complaint against the person.  Under this bill, a law enforcement officer may release such a person without determining that there are insufficient grounds to issue a criminal complaint.\n\nIf the court allows the release of a defendant before conviction or the release of a convicted person prior to sentencing, this bill specifies that the court may either release the person to return on a specific date without conditions or release the person on a personal recognizance bond, an unsecured appearance bond, or a secured appearance bond.  This bill also allows a third party who has deposited cash for the release of a person on a secured appearance bond to apply to the court for an order to return the deposit before the entry of a judgment of conviction or forfeiture.  The court then may determine whether to remit the deposit and whether to modify the conditions of release.\n\nThis bill generally requires a court to release a person who is arrested without a warrant within 48 hours of the arrest unless the court has determined there is probable cause to arrest the person.\n\nUnder this bill, chapter 970 contains provisions relating to the commencement of prosecutions.\n\nThis bill replaces several statutes governing deferred prosecution agreements in specific cases with one general statute defining and authorizing deferred and suspended prosecution agreements.  The bill provides that the same standards that govern a district attorney's charging authority also govern the district attorney's authority to enter into a deferred prosecution agreement and that the same standards that apply to a court's authority to schedule cases and grant continuances apply to a court's authority to suspend prosecution under a suspended prosecution agreement.  Under this bill, both a deferred prosecution agreement and a suspended prosecution agreement are enforceable in the same manner as a plea agreement.  The bill further notes that consenting to a deferred prosecution or suspended prosecution agreement is not an admission of guilt nor is the consent admissible in a trial relating to the charge to which the agreement pertains.  This bill makes generally applicable a provision in current law that grants immunity from civil liability in excess of $25,000 for acts or omissions by an organization or individual for whom an agreement assigns an individual to work.\n\nUnder this bill, chapter 971 addresses pretrial procedures and contains subchapters for commencement of proceedings, pleas, and provisions to expedite proceedings, discovery, motions, and juveniles in adult court.  This bill creates one general statute for plea agreements.  The bill provides that the district attorney and the defendant, without the court's participation, may reach a plea agreement.  The agreement may require the district attorney, if the defendant enters a plea of guilty or no contest, to take certain actions, including moving to dismiss or amend any charge; recommending the defendant's request for a particular disposition; or agreeing that a specific disposition is appropriate.  The bill also creates a single statute to clarify, and explain the consequences of, the different pleas available to the defendant.\n\nUnder current law, before a court may dismiss a criminal case, the court must inquire if the district attorney has offered all of the victims an opportunity to confer with the district attorney concerning the prosecution and outcome of the case.  This bill codifies case law by adding that, if the district attorney moves to dismiss a complaint, the trial court must grant the motion unless the court finds that dismissal is contrary to the public interest or, if the motion is made during the trial, unless the defendant has not consented.\n\nUnder the bill, unless the district attorney establishes substantial prejudice, the court must grant a motion, made before sentencing, to withdraw a plea of guilty or no contest if a fair and just reason for doing so is established.  Under this bill, the court must grant such a motion, made after sentencing, if the defendant did not knowingly, voluntarily, and understandingly enter the plea or if withdrawal is required to prevent a manifest injustice.  Finally, the bill specifies that a withdrawal of a plea of guilty or no contest vacates the judgment, reinstates any original charge, and restores the parties to the position they were in before the plea was accepted.\n\nThis bill specifies that discovery is intended to do all of the following:  promote fair and expeditious disposition of criminal charges, provide the defendant with sufficient information to make an informed plea, permit thorough preparation for and minimize surprise at trial, reduce interruptions and complications during trial and avoid unnecessary trials by resolving any issues before trial, minimize inequities among similarly situated defendants, effect economies, and minimize the burden upon victims and witnesses.\n\nCurrent law requires a district attorney, upon demand and within a reasonable time before trial, to disclose to the defendant any relevant expert reports or statements or, if an expert does not prepare a report or statement, a written summary of the expert's findings or the subject of his or her testimony, and the results of any examination, scientific test, experiment, or comparison that the district attorney intends to offer in evidence.  This bill requires any party who intends to call an expert witness to, not less than 30 days before trial, notify the other party of the expert's name, address, and qualifications and furnish any relevant expert reports or statements or, if none, a written summary of the expert's findings or the subject matter of his or her testimony, and the results of any mental examination, scientific test, experiment, or comparison that the first party intends to offer in evidence.\n\nUnder this bill, before trial and upon motion by either party, the court may issue a subpoena to require the production of documents and other tangible objects if the evidence may be material to the determination of issues.  The motion and the subpoena must specify who must produce the material, whether certified copies of documents may be submitted in lieu of appearance, and other conditions.\n\nUnder this bill, the disclosure of discoverable material may be accomplished in any manner mutually agreeable to the parties.  If the parties do not agree, the party that has the duty to disclose must either provide a copy of the material to be disclosed or notify the other party that the material may be inspected, copied, or photographed during specified reasonable times and provide suitable machinery for making copies.\n\nThis bill codifies the authority of courts to issue and amend scheduling orders.\n\nUnder this bill, the court may, upon motion by the district attorney, order a defendant to participate in a reasonable procedure to obtain nontestimonial evidence.  Such procedures include appearing, moving, or speaking for identification in a lineup; trying on clothing or other articles; providing handwriting or voice exemplars; being photographed; having fingerprints or other body impressions taken; providing samples of blood, urine, saliva, semen, skin, breath, hair, or nails or materials under the nails; submitting to body measurements or other reasonable body surface examinations; and submitting to physical or medical inspection.\n\nUnder this bill, the court may, upon motion of a defendant, require an individual to participate in a reasonable procedure to obtain nontestimonial evidence if an affidavit or testimony shows probable cause to believe that the individual committed the crime with which the defendant is charged and that the evidence sought is necessary to an adequate defense and cannot practicably be obtained from other sources.\n\nUnder this bill, the district attorney may provide discovery before the initial appearance.  Also, this bill requires the district attorney to disclose, at the initial appearance after the defendant has obtained or waived legal representation, any pertinent law enforcement investigative reports the district attorney has and a copy of the defendant's criminal record.\n\nUnder current law, the procedure for asserting that a statute is unconstitutional is located in the civil procedure statutes.  This bill moves to the criminal procedure code the provision that, if a defendant moves to dismiss a criminal prosecution by asserting that the statute under which he or she is charged is unconstitutional, the defendant must serve the motion on the attorney general and the district attorney.\n\nThis bill specifies that, if a defendant moves for severance because a codefendant's out-of-court statement refers to, but is not admissible against, the defendant and the court determines that the state intends to offer the statement in evidence, the court must require the district attorney to elect one of the following:  1) a joint trial at which the statement is not received in evidence; 2) a joint trial at which the statement is received in evidence only after all references to the defendant have been deleted, if admission of such a statement will not cause prejudice; 3) a separate trial for the defendant; or 4) if the court approves, a single trial with a separate jury for the defendant and the codefendant.\n\nUnder this bill, chapter 972 contains statutes relating to criminal trials.  Under this bill, if the court at a criminal trial authorizes the jurors to ask questions of witnesses, the court must instruct the jury to ask only questions that clarify information already presented and must instruct the jury of the procedure to be used.  The procedure provides that the question must be submitted in writing to the judge who will show the question to the parties.  The parties may object to the question without the jury knowing.  If the judge, upon reviewing the question and any objections, determines that the question is legally proper, the judge may ask it of the witness.\n\nThis bill clarifies procedures for jury selection and handling alternate jurors.  Under current law, if the number of jurors, including any additional jurors selected, exceeds the required number when the case is submitted to the jury, the court must discharge by lot jurors that will not participate in deliberations.  Under this bill, the court may, for good cause, discharge additional jurors other than by lot.  Moreover, this bill allows the court to determine which jurors will not participate in deliberations but retain those jurors as alternates after the jury retires to deliberate.  If a juror who is participating in deliberations becomes unavailable due to severe illness or extraordinary circumstances, the judge may replace the unavailable juror with a retained alternate juror.  If an alternate replaces a juror after deliberations have begun, the court must instruct the jury to begin its deliberations anew.\n\nThis bill defines \"stipulation\" as an agreement between the parties that a specified fact is taken as established without need for proof.  Further, a stipulation must be set forth on the record when the court accepts it, and, in a jury trial, the court must instruct the jury to take stipulated facts as conclusively proved.\n\nThis bill specifies that a verdict must be unanimous and returned in open court.  Under current case law, a defendant in a criminal case has the right to poll the jury, and refusal to permit the defendant to do so is an error for which the verdict will be set aside.  This bill requires a court to ask each juror individually whether the verdict as returned was and is the juror's verdict.  This bill requires the court to accept the verdict if it is in proper form and confirmed by the poll.\n\nUnder this bill, chapter 975 addresses mental health issues affecting a criminal prosecution such as competency to stand trial and mental responsibility, commonly known as the \"insanity defense.\"  Under current law, when there is reason to doubt a defendant's competency to proceed in a criminal action, the court must appoint an examiner to submit a report on the condition of the defendant that contains specified findings.  This bill adds that, if the examiner reports that the defendant is not competent to proceed and that the defendant is not likely to become competent within the maximum period of commitment under the competency statutes, the examiner must provide his or her opinion on whether the defendant meets the criteria for civil commitment.\n\nThe bill reorganizes the competency hearing statutes and makes certain changes to burdens of persuasion.  Under current law, at the outset of the competency hearing, if the defendant claims to be incompetent or is silent, the defendant must be found incompetent unless the state proves by the greater weight of the credible evidence that the defendant is competent.  Under current law, if the defendant claims to be competent, the defendant must be found competent unless the state proves by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant is incompetent.  Under the bill, the state has the burden of going forward with evidence at a competency hearing, and the court may find the defendant competent to proceed only if the court finds by the greater weight of the evidence that the defendant is competent to proceed.  The bill specifies the following:  1) if the defendant is not competent and the court finds by the greater weight of the evidence that the defendant is not likely to become competent within the maximum period of commitment, the court must order the defendant be released or delivered to a facility; 2) if the defendant is not competent and the court finds by the greater weight of the evidence that the defendant is likely to become competent within the maximum period of commitment without inpatient treatment, the court must order that the defendant be released and may require the defendant to participate in outpatient treatment, or undergo periodic reexaminations to determine whether the defendant has become competent to proceed, for a period that does not exceed the maximum period of commitment; or 3) if the defendant is not competent and the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant is likely to become competent within the maximum period of commitment if provided appropriate inpatient treatment, the court must commit the defendant to the custody of the Department of Health Services (DHS) for treatment.  Finally, if the defendant is committed to DHS and the state proves by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant is not competent to refuse medication or treatment, the court must find that the defendant is not competent to refuse medication or treatment and must order whoever administers medication or treatment to the defendant to observe appropriate medical standards.\n\nUnder current law, if the defendant is committed to the custody of DHS for treatment following a competency proceeding, the days spent in commitment are given credit toward the service of his or her sentence for the same course of conduct.  This bill requires the court to include in the commitment order a specific finding of the number of days spent in precommitment custody.\n\nCurrent law requires DHS to periodically reexamine the defendant and to submit to the court a written report on the defendant's mental condition at three months, six months, and nine months after commitment.  This bill requires an additional report if DHS determines that the defendant has become competent or that the defendant is not likely to become competent within the remaining commitment period and requires the court to schedule a review of this additional report within 14 days.\n\nThis bill creates a process for the court to follow whenever the court determines there is reason to doubt a defendant's competency to proceed when seeking an appeal or a motion for postconviction relief.  Pending the determination or after a finding of incompetency, the circuit court may allow proceedings on any issue raised by the defendant's attorney that rests on the records, does not require the defendant to assist counsel or make a decision, and involves no risk to the defendant and the court of appeals may grant the defendant a continuance or lengthen the time for filing necessary notices or motions for postconviction relief.  If the court finds that the defendant lacks competency, the court may appoint a guardian to make decisions or may order treatment to restore the defendant to competency to pursue postconviction relief.  Finally, the bill provides that a defendant who lacks competency to pursue postconviction relief may, after regaining competency, raise any issue at a later proceeding that he or she did not raise earlier because of incompetency.\n\nUnder current law, if a defendant is found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect, the court must enter a judgment of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect and proceed to commitment.  The judgment is interlocutory to the commitment order and reviewable upon appeal.  Under this bill, the court must proceed to a dispositional hearing and the commitment order is the final order and is appealable as a matter of right.  Upon appeal, this bill provides that all properly preserved issues, including those relating to the guilt phase of the trial, may be raised.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB82,1\n\n1Section \n1.  6.10 (7m) (a) (intro.) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB82,17,52\n6.10 (7m) (a) (intro.)

An implement of husbandry is a self-propelled or towed vehicle that is manufactured, designed, or reconstructed to be used and that is exclusively used in the conduct of agricultural operations.  An implement of husbandry may include a farm tractor or a towed vehicle such as a farm trailer or manure trailer.  An implement of husbandry may also include such farm equipment as a self-propelled combine; a self-propelled forage harvester; self-propelled fertilizer or pesticide application equipment (but not including manure application equipment); a power unit towing tillage, planting, or cultivation equipment; or another self-propelled vehicle that directly engages in harvesting farm products, directly applies fertilizer, spray, or seeds (but not manure), or distributes feed to livestock (hereafter \"farm equipment\").  An implement of husbandry may also be a combination of vehicles in which each vehicle in the combination is an implement of husbandry or in which a towed implement of husbandry, such as a farm trailer, is towed by a farm truck, farm truck tractor, or motor truck.  An agricultural CMV is a commercial motor vehicle that:  1) is substantially designed or equipped, or materially altered from its original construction, for the purpose of agricultural use; 2) was designed and manufactured primarily for highway use and, with an exception, was manufactured to meet federal motor vehicle highway safety standards; 3) is used exclusively in the conduct of agricultural operations; and 4) is directly engaged in harvesting farm products, directly applies fertilizer, spray, or seeds to a farm field, or distributes feed to livestock.  An agricultural CMV is not an implement of husbandry.\n\nThis bill makes changes to the definitions of implement of husbandry and agricultural CMV.  Under the bill, a combination of vehicles is an implement of husbandry if the combination consists of any implement of husbandry towed by a farm truck, farm truck tractor, or motor truck.  The bill also specifies that a power unit towing harvesting equipment is an implement of husbandry of the farm equipment type and that a grain cart is an implement of husbandry of the same type as a farm trailer.  The bill clarifies that, if an implement of husbandry consists of a power unit towing tillage, planting, harvesting, or cultivation equipment, the power unit may be a farm tractor.  The bill also specifies that a vehicle directly applying lime to a farm field may be an agricultural CMV.  Under the bill, an agricultural CMV includes a vehicle assisting a harvesting vehicle by receiving farm products as they are harvested and includes a vehicle off-loading manure when field conditions do not permit manure application directly to the field.\n\nUnder current law, no person may operate on a highway any vehicle or combination of vehicles that exceeds certain statutory size or weight limits unless the person obtains a permit issued by the Department of Transportation (DOT) or a local highway authority or unless an exception applies.  Statutory restrictions on vehicle size and weight generally apply to the vehicle as loaded.  The general statutory weight limits on vehicles and vehicle combinations operated on a highway include weight limits per wheel, axle, and group of axles (based on the number and spacing of axles).  DOT and local highway authorities may also impose, by posting highway signs on weakened highways, special weight limits that are less than the general statutory weight limits.  In addition, local authorities may designate highways under their jurisdiction as class \"B\" highways, which results, with exceptions, in the maximum permissible weight for vehicles on these highways being reduced to 60 percent of the otherwise applicable statutory weight.\n\nUnder current law, increased statutory per-axle and per-axle group weight limits for implements of husbandry and agricultural CMVs are approximately 15 percent higher than the general statutory weight limits.  However, an implement of husbandry or agricultural CMV operated on a highway may not, without a permit, have a gross weight of more than 92,000 pounds, subject to limited exceptions.  The increased weight allowance for implements of husbandry and agricultural CMVs, and the gross weight limit of 92,000 pounds, expires on January 1, 2020, at which time the general statutory weight limits again apply to implements of husbandry and agricultural CMVs.\n\nUnder current law, there are additional weight limit exceptions applicable to implements of husbandry and agricultural CMVs operated on a highway, which also expire on January 1, 2020.  For example, there is no weight limit per wheel, axle, or group of axles for any of the following implements of husbandry:  1) an empty potato harvester if certain conditions are met; 2) farm equipment traveling between fields, or between a farm and a field, on the highway for a distance of 0.5 miles or less; or 3) farm equipment operated on a highway under the jurisdiction of a county or municipality, unless the county or municipality has adopted an ordinance designating statutory weight limits for the highway.  A potato harvester identified in item 1), above, and farm equipment identified in item 3), above, is subject to the gross weight limit of 92,000 pounds, but farm equipment identified in item 2), above, is not.  These implements of husbandry identified in items 1) to 3), above, are subject to posted special weight limits but are not subject to a reduction of permissible weight on class \"B\" highways.  In addition, there is no weight limit per wheel, axle, or group of axles, and no gross weight limit, for an implement of husbandry or agricultural CMV being operated or transported by an implement dealer or farmer for repair, servicing, or delivery if certain conditions are met, but these vehicles are subject to posted special weight limits.  If a county or municipality has adopted an ordinance designating statutory weight limits for farm equipment as provided in item 3), above, the ordinance must be valid for at least one calendar year and must be adopted on or before January 15 of the calendar year in which it takes effect.  The county or municipality must also forward to DOT a copy of the ordinance and DOT must publish it on DOT's Internet site.\n\nThis bill provides that the additional weight limit exceptions identified in items 2) and 3), above, also apply to an agricultural CMV except when being used to apply or offload manure or assist a harvester.  The bill expands the increased weight limit for implements of husbandry and agricultural CMVs operated on a highway to also apply to two-vehicle combinations transporting by trailer or semitrailer an implement of husbandry or agricultural CMV from farm to field, from field to field, or from farm to farm.  Subject to the exceptions discussed below, the 92,000 pound gross weight limit also applies to these two-vehicle combinations transporting implements of husbandry or agricultural CMVs, and this increased weight allowance also expires on January 1, 2020.  The bill further provides that the additional weight limit exceptions identified in items 1) to 3), above, also apply to a two-vehicle combination transporting by trailer or semitrailer such an implement of husbandry or agricultural CMV (with respect to items 2) and 3)) from farm to field, from field to field, or from farm to farm.  Under the bill, an ordinance designating statutory weight limits for farm equipment as provided in item 3), above, and any amendment to such an ordinance, must be adopted on or before November 30 of the year before the ordinance or amendment takes effect and must be forwarded to DOT no later than January 20 of the year it takes effect.  The bill also removes a limitation under current law that provisions applicable to potato harvesters apply only if the potato harvester is a self-propelled vehicle.\n\nUnder current law, a \"maintaining authority\" of a highway may issue a \"no-fee permit\" authorizing operation on the highway of implements of husbandry and agricultural CMVs that exceed statutory weight limits.  These permits may be issued, and remain valid, only until January 1, 2020.  Current law defines a \"maintaining authority\" of a highway as:  1) DOT or its designee, with respect to a state trunk highway; or 2) the municipality or county responsible for maintenance of the highway or its designee (local authority), with respect to a highway that is not a state trunk highway.  An application for a no-fee permit must be accompanied by a listing or map of the highways that may potentially be traveled under authorization of the permit.  With limited exceptions, information in the permit application must be kept confidential.  If a no-fee permit is issued, upon application, the no-fee permit may be amended by the maintaining authority to reflect changes in the applicant's circumstances, including a change in the highways to be traveled.  If a maintaining authority denies an application for a no-fee permit, it must notify the applicant in writing of the denial and the notice must include a reasonable and structurally based explanation of the denial that relates to the preservation of the roadway.  If the application is made with respect to farm equipment and the only basis to deny the application is the listing or map of highways accompanying the application, the maintaining authority must modify the application to include an approved alternate route or map of highways for operation of the farm equipment and approve the application.  This approved alternate route or map of highways may include highways that are not under the jurisdiction of the maintaining authority issuing the permit only upon prior approval of the maintaining authority having jurisdiction over those highways.  If a no-fee permit application is denied, the applicant has a right to administrative review of the decision.\n\nThis bill allows a no-fee permit to be issued for a two-vehicle combination transporting by trailer or semitrailer an implement of husbandry or agricultural CMV from farm to field, from field to field, or from farm to farm.  In addition, for purposes of permit issuance, the bill treats agricultural CMVs in a manner similar to farm equipment.  The bill also specifies that a vehicle or vehicle combination operating under a no-fee permit on a highway under the jurisdiction of the maintaining authority that issued the permit may cross any intersecting highway.  Under the bill, a municipality is not subject to open meetings requirements in making its initial determination on an application for a no-fee permit.  The bill further requires a local authority, in a meeting to review the denial of a no-fee permit application, to deliberate or conduct any proceeding related to the review in closed session, with the permit applicant present for any evidentiary hearing or argument.  The local authority must keep confidential all information provided by the permit applicant during the proceeding, but this information may be included in the written decision and may be disclosed in any court proceeding for judicial review of the decision.\n\nUnder current law, a county or municipality may, by ordinance, authorize operation of implements of husbandry and agricultural CMVs exceeding statutory length or weight limitations on any or all highways under the county's or municipality's jurisdiction.  The ordinance serves as a no-fee permit.  The ordinance must be valid for at least one calendar year and must be adopted on or before January 15 of the calendar year in which it takes effect.  The county or municipality must also forward to DOT a copy of the ordinance and DOT must publish it on DOT's Internet site.  Under the bill, the ordinance, and any amendment to the ordinance, must be adopted on or before November 30 of the year before the ordinance or amendment takes effect and must be forwarded to DOT no later than January 20 of the year it takes effect.\n\nUnder current law, unless an exception applies, a person may not, without a permit, operate on a highway any vehicle having a total width in excess of 8 feet 6 inches.  However, there is generally no width limitation for implements of husbandry operated on a highway, although certain wide implements of husbandry are subject to lighting and marking requirements.  There is also no width limitation if the implement of husbandry is being operated or transported by an implement dealer or farmer for repair, servicing, or delivery and certain conditions are met.\n\nUnder this bill, there is no width limitation for implements of husbandry being transported by trailer or semitrailer on a highway from farm to field, from field to field, or from farm to farm, at times other than hours of darkness, although certain wide implements of husbandry are subject to lighting and marking requirements.\n\nUnder current law, unless an exception applies, a person may not, without a permit, operate on a highway any single vehicle with an overall length in excess of 45 feet or any combination of two vehicles with an overall length in excess of 70 feet.  Under one exception, an implement of husbandry operated on a highway without a permit may not exceed 60 feet in length if the implement of husbandry is a single vehicle or 100 feet in length if the implement of husbandry is a two-vehicle combination.  These same length limits also apply if the implement of husbandry is being operated or transported by an implement dealer or farmer for repair, servicing, or delivery and certain conditions are met.\n\nUnder this bill, these same length limits also apply to an implement of husbandry being transported by trailer or semitrailer on a highway from farm to field, from field to field, or from farm to farm.  The bill also provides for an overall length limit of 100 feet for a two-vehicle combination transporting by trailer or semitrailer an implement of husbandry from farm to field, from field to field, or from farm to farm.\n\nUnder current law, unless an exception applies, a person may not, without a permit, operate on a highway any vehicle having an overall height in excess of 13.5 feet.  Under one exception, there is no height limit for an implement of husbandry.  However, with an exception, the operator of the implement of husbandry is responsible for ensuring that there is adequate height clearance between the implement of husbandry and overhead structures or obstructions.\n\nUnder this bill, there is no height limit for a two-vehicle combination transporting by trailer or semitrailer an implement of husbandry from farm to field, from field to field, or from farm to farm, but the operator of the two-vehicle combination is, with an exception, responsible for ensuring that there is adequate height clearance between the implement of husbandry being transported and any overhead structure or obstruction.\n\nUnder current law, vehicle equipment requirements do not apply to implements of husbandry unless application is expressly specified by statute.  Current law prohibits a person from operating on a highway any vehicle, including an implement of husbandry, that has on the periphery of its tires any flange, cleat, or other protuberance of any material other than rubber that projects beyond the tread of the traction surface of the tire, except that implements of husbandry may be operated with metal tires or tires having protuberances that will not injure the highway.\n\nThis bill specifies that an implement of husbandry having rubber tracks or tracks made of equivalent material may be operated on a highway if it will not injure the highway.\n\nUnder current law, if any bill introduced in either house of the legislature directly or indirectly establishes an exception to vehicle weight limits, DOT must prepare a report, containing specified information, relating to the bill within six weeks after the bill is introduced and before any vote is taken on the bill.\n\nThis bill directs DOT not to prepare such a report on this bill.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB83,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  340.01 (1o) (e) of the statutes is renumbered 340.01 (1o) (e) (intro.) 2and amended to read:\nSB83,7,2\n1340.01 (1o) (e) (intro.)

Among those privileges is the privilege to hunt with assistance rendered by another person or to shoot or hunt from a stationary vehicle.  Generally, in order to obtain a specialized permit, a person must submit an application furnished by DNR that includes a statement or report prepared and signed by a licensed physician or other specified medical professional, such as a chiropractor or podiatrist, verifying that the applicant has a particular disability.  For certain permits that require testing, current law specifies the type of medical professional who is authorized to direct the administration of those tests.\n\nCurrent law also authorizes DNR to issue an annual disabled person fishing license to a person who is receiving certain disability benefits under federal law or whose sight is impaired as certified by a licensed physician or optometrist.\n\nThis bill allows licensed physician assistants and advanced practice nurse prescribers, in addition to the medical professionals specified in current law, to provide the information required by DNR to determine if a person's disability qualifies him or her for a specialized permit.  The bill also allows a physician assistant or advanced practice nurse prescriber to certify that a person's sight is impaired for the purpose of obtaining a disabled person fishing license.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB88,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  29.193 (1m) (a) 2.

A charter school established by an entity other than a school board is known as an independent charter school.\n\nThis bill allows each technical college district board, including the MATC district board, to authorize independent charter high schools that provide a curriculum focused on occupational education and training or science, technology, engineering, and math (independent charter technical schools).  An independent charter technical school must be located within the boundaries of the authorizer's technical college district or in a county adjacent to the district.  This bill does not otherwise affect MATC's authority under current law to authorize independent charter schools.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB91,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  118.40 (2r) (b) 1. d. of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB91,2,22\n118.40 (2r) (b) 1. d.

Referred to Committee on Revenue, Financial Institutions, and Rural Issues.\n\nSB92,1,5\n1An Act to renumber and amend 425.109 (1) (d); to amend 425.109 (1) (intro.), 2425.109 (1) (b), 425.109 (1) (f), 425.109 (1) (h), 425.109 (2), 425.109 (3) and 3425.205 (4); and to create 425.1025, 425.109 (1) (d) 2. and 425.109 (4) of the 4statutes; relating to: pleading requirements under the Wisconsin Consumer 5Act.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nUnder current law, a consumer credit transaction in which the amount financed is $25,000 or less, and which is entered into for personal, family, or household purposes, is generally subject to the Wisconsin Consumer Act (WCA).  A consumer credit transaction means a transaction between a merchant and a customer in which property, services, or money is acquired on credit and the customer's obligation is payable in installments or a finance charge may be imposed.  A merchant is defined to include, among others, a creditor or a seller of property on credit and expressly includes such a creditor's or seller's assignee or successor.  A customer is a person, other than an organization, who seeks or acquires property, services, money, or credit for personal, family, or household purposes.  A creditor is defined as a merchant who regularly engages in consumer credit transactions or in arranging for the extension of consumer credit by, or procuring consumer credit from, third persons.  A consumer credit transaction may involve a consumer credit sale, a consumer loan, a consumer lease, or a transaction pursuant to an open-end credit plan (usually involving use of a credit card).\n\nUnder current law, the WCA includes requirements for a creditor or merchant to satisfy to enforce rights arising from a consumer credit transaction, including pleading requirements for a complaint filed by a creditor to enforce these rights.  Among the information that must be included in such a complaint, the creditor must identify the consumer credit transaction; describe any collateral sought to be recovered; specify the facts constituting the customer's alleged default; identify the actual or estimated amount of money that the creditor is entitled to recover and the figures necessary for computation of this amount; and include an accurate copy of the writings evidencing the transaction except that, for a claim arising under an open-end credit plan, the creditor may substitute a statement that the creditor will, upon request, provide copies of the writings evidencing the customer's obligation.  A judgment may not be entered on a complaint that fails to comply with these pleading requirements.  For a claim arising under an open-end credit plan, on written request by the customer, the creditor must submit accurate copies to the customer and the court of writings evidencing any transaction on which the claim is made and judgment may not be entered for the creditor unless the creditor does so.\n\nThis bill modifies the pleading requirements in WCA cases.  First, under the bill, these pleading requirements apply to a merchant, rather than a creditor.  As defined under current law, a merchant expressly includes an assignee of or successor to a creditor or seller on credit.  Second, the bill changes the manner in which a merchant is required to plead the amount owed by the customer.  Under the bill, the merchant must identify the actual or estimated amount of money alleged to be due to the merchant on a date certain after the customer's default, and include a breakdown of all charges, interest, and payments occurring after this date certain.  If the claim arises under an open-end credit plan, the amount alleged to be due on a date certain must be reflected in a billing statement addressed to the customer.  Third, the bill specifies that, for a claim arising under an open-end credit plan in which the merchant has not attached to the complaint copies of the writings evidencing the customer's obligation and the customer has requested these copies, the merchant's obligation to provide these copies is satisfied if the merchant provides the customer and court with a copy of this billing statement reflecting the total outstanding balance on the customer's account.  The merchant may also satisfy its obligation by attaching copies of this billing statement to the complaint.  Fourth, under the bill, the merchant's failure to comply with these requirements related to pleading and providing copies precludes entry of default judgment, rather than judgment, for the merchant.  Fifth, under the bill, a complaint that fails to comply with these pleading requirements is not a violation that gives rise to a penalty, civil liability, or an award of attorney fees under the WCA unless the customer establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the failure to comply was willful or intentional.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB92,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  425.1025 of the statutes is created to read:\nSB92,3,3\n2425.1025  Definition.

This 20paragraph does not require a specific itemization, but the breakdown shall identify 21separately the amount due on a date certain, the total of all charges occurring after 22this date certain, the total of all interest occurring after this date certain, and the 23total of all payments occurring after this date certain.\nSB92,5\n\n\n24Section \n5.  425.109 (1) (d) 2. of the statutes is created to read:\nSB92,4,9\n1425.109 (1) (d) 2.

This paragraph does not require a specific itemization, but the 7breakdown shall identify separately the amount due on a date certain, the total of 8all charges occurring after this date certain, the total of all interest occurring after 9this date certain, and the total of all payments occurring after this date certain.\nSB92,6\n\n\n10Section \n6.  425.109 (1) (f) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB92,4,1611\n425.109 (1) (f)  Except in an action to recover goods subject to a consumer lease, 12the estimated amount of U.S. dollars or of a named foreign currency of any deficiency 13claim which may be available to the creditor merchant following the disposition of 14any collateral recovered subject to the limitations of s. 425.209 or which the creditor 15merchant seeks to recover and which the creditor merchant intends to assert subject 16to the limitations of s. 425.210 if the customer fails to redeem the collateral.\nSB92,7\n\n\n17Section \n7.  425.109 (1) (h) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB92,4,2318\n425.109 (1) (h)  An Subject to sub.

The writings requirement under this subsection is satisfied if the merchant 7provides the customer with a copy of the billing statement referenced in sub. (1) (d) 81. addressed to the customer reflecting the total outstanding balance on the 9customer's account at the time this billing statement was issued.  If this billing 10statement is attached to the complaint, then the statement under sub.

Referred to Committee on Labor and Government Reform.\n\nSB94,1,6\n1An Act to renumber and amend 145.02 (2); \nto amend 101.63 (1) (intro.) and 2101.82 (1); and to create 145.02 (2) (b) of the statutes; relating to: standards 3for the construction and inspection of camping units; for installing, repairing, 4and maintaining electrical wiring in camping units; and for plumbing in 5camping units; providing an exemption from emergency rule procedures; and 6granting rule-making authority.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nUnder current law, any one-family or two-family dwelling for which initial construction began on or after December 1, 1978, must comply with the one-family and two-family dwelling code (dwelling code).  Under current law, the Department of Safety and Professional Services (DSPS) promulgates rules for this code which includes standards for heating, ventilation, plumbing, electricity, and other systems.  One-family and two-family dwellings for which initial construction began before that date are not covered by this code but are subject to the state electrical and plumbing codes.\n\nThis bill provides that DSPS's rules for the dwelling code, the electrical code, and the plumbing code must include separate standards that apply only to camping units that are set in a fixed location in a campground for which the Department of Health Services has issued a permit, that contain a sleeping place, and that are used for seasonal overnight camping.  The bill provides that if DSPS has appointed a committee to advise DSPS on rule making with respect to private on-site wastewater treatment systems, DSPS must promulgate the separate standards under the plumbing code in consultation with that committee.\n\nFor further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB94,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  101.63 (1) (intro.) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB94,2,162\n101.63 (1) (intro.)

No set of rules may 11be adopted which has not taken into account the conservation of energy in 12construction and maintenance of dwellings and the costs of specific code provisions 13to home buyers in relationship to the benefits derived from the provisions.

The restraining order generally prohibits the person from engaging in additional threats or acts of abuse or harassment, bars the person from contacting the victim, and requires the person to stay away from the victim's residence and other places temporarily occupied by the victim until a court conducts a hearing to determine whether the restraining order should be incorporated into a longer-lasting injunction.\n\nIf the court determines that the person has engaged in, or may engage in, acts of abuse, harassment, or threats against the victim, the court may issue a longer-term injunction against the person.  An injunction generally bars the person from contacting the victim, requires the person to stay away from the victim's residence, and may require the person to stay away from other locations temporarily occupied by the victim.\n\nUnder this bill, a court may include in a restraining order or an injunction order provisions pertaining to household pets.  Under the bill, a court may order the person subject to the restraining order or injunction to refrain from removing, damaging, hiding, harming, or mistreating, or disposing of a household pet.  The restraining order or injunction may also allow the victim of the abuse, harassment, or threats, or a person acting on his or her behalf, to retrieve a household pet from the person subject to the restraining order or injunction.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB97,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  813.12 (1) (ce) of the statutes is created to read:\nSB97,2,42\n813.12 (1) (ce)  \"Household pet\" means a domestic animal that is not a farm 3animal, as defined in s. 951.01 (3), that is kept, owned, or cared for by the petitioner 4or by a family member or a household member of the petitioner.\nSB97,2\n\n\n5Section \n2.  813.12 (3) (aj) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB97,3,26\n813.12 (3) (aj)  In determining whether to issue a temporary restraining order, 7the judge or circuit court commissioner shall consider the potential danger posed to 8the petitioner and the pattern of abusive conduct of the respondent but may not base 9his or her decision solely on the length of time since the last domestic abuse or the 10length of time since the relationship ended.  The judge or circuit court commissioner 11may grant only the remedies requested or approved by the petitioner.  \nThe judge or 12circuit court commissioner may order the respondent not to remove, hide, damage, 13harm, or mistreat, or dispose of, a household pet and may order the respondent to 14allow the petitioner or a family member or household member of the petitioner acting 15on his or her behalf to retrieve a household pet.

Current law defines a shoreland to be an area within a certain distance from the edge of a navigable water.

Referred to Committee on Economic Development and Commerce.\n\nSB105,1,4\n1An Act to create 60.85 (2) (b) 8. of the statutes; relating to: limited 2authorization for the town of Rome in Adams County to make cash grants or 3loan subsidies to owners, lessees, or developers of land located in a tax 4incremental district created by the town.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nUnder the current tax incremental financing program, a city or village may create a tax incremental district (TID) in part of its territory to foster development if at least 50 percent of the area to be included in the TID is blighted, in need of rehabilitation or conservation, suitable for industrial sites, or suitable for mixed-use development.  Currently, towns and counties also have a limited ability to create a TID under certain circumstances.  Before a city or village may create a TID, several steps and plans are required.  These steps and plans include public hearings on the proposed TID within specified time frames, preparation and adoption by the local planning commission of a proposed project plan for the TID, approval of the proposed project plan by the common council or village board, approval of the city's or village's proposed TID by a joint review board that consists of members who represent the overlying taxation districts, and adoption of a resolution by the common council or village board that creates the TID as of a date provided in the resolution.\n\nUnder the current law limitations on towns to use tax incremental financing (TIF), a town may create a TID for projects related to tourism, agriculture, manufacturing, or forestry.  A town may also use TIF for residential projects, but only to the extent that the residential project has a necessary and incidental relationship to a tourism, agricultural, manufacturing, or forestry project, and for retail projects to the extent that the retail development is related to the retail sale of a product that is produced due to an agricultural, forestry, or manufacturing project.\n\nA town may also create a TID in limited circumstances under which the town enters into a cooperative plan with a city or village under which part or all of the town will be annexed or attached by the city or village.\n\nThis bill authorizes the town of Rome in Adams County to make direct cash grants or loan subsidies to an owner, lessee, or developer of land in a TID that includes a golf course.  The authorization created in the bill may only be used for one TID.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB105,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  60.85 (2) (b) 8. of the statutes is created to read:\nSB105,2,102\n60.85 (2) (b) 8.

Referred to Committee on Education Reform and Government Operations.\n\nSB106,1,5\n1An Act to amend 194.01 (1) and 194.01 (2); and to create 340.01 (23g) (b) 4., 2440.08 (2) (a) 69m. and subchapter IV of chapter 440 [precedes 440.40] of the 3statutes; relating to: regulation of transportation network companies, 4providing an exemption from emergency rule procedures, granting 5rule-making authority, and providing a penalty.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nThis bill creates a licensure program for transportation network companies to be administered by the Department of Safety and Professional Services (DSPS).  Under the bill, a \"transportation network company\" (TNC) is a business that, for compensation, uses a digital network to connect individuals seeking transportation via the digital network (passengers) to drivers who are logged on to the digital network and receive compensation for providing that transportation (participating drivers).  The bill specifies that a TNC is not a taxicab, limousine, shuttle, or other for-hire vehicle service.  The participating driver pays a fee to the TNC in order to participate in the TNC's digital network.\n\nUnder the bill, a TNC may only operate in Wisconsin if it is licensed by DSPS, and a participating driver may only provide transportation network services (TNC services) through a licensed TNC.  There is no licensure requirement for a participating driver under the bill.\n\nThe bill requires DSPS to grant a license to an applicant for licensure as a TNC if certain application requirements are satisfied, including that the TNC pays an initial licensure fee of $5,000.  The biennial renewal fee is also $5,000.\n\nThe bill exempts TNCs and participating drivers and their vehicles used to provide TNC services from certain requirements applicable under current law to common motor carrier and other for-hire vehicles.  The bill also prohibits a city, village, town, or county from enacting or enforcing an ordinance or adopting or enforcing a resolution that regulates TNCs or their participating drivers and vehicles used to provide TNC services.  Under current law, a city, town, or village is authorized to regulate and license taxicab businesses, taxicabs, and chauffeurs.  That authorization does not apply to TNCs or their participating drivers and vehicles under the bill.\n\nThe bill includes a number of requirements applicable to a licensed TNC and its participating drivers, including all of the following:\n\n1.  A TNC must disclose its fare calculation method and other fare information on its Internet site and to prospective passengers, must provide certain identifying information about the participating driver to a prospective passenger before the prospective passenger receives TNC services, and must transmit an electronic receipt that contains specific information to a passenger within a reasonable time after TNC service have been provided.\n\n2.  A participating driver may not solicit or accept street hails or otherwise provide rides for compensation that are not prearranged through a TNC, and all payments for TNC services must be made electronically using the TNC's digital network.\n\n3.  A TNC may not disclose a passenger's or prospective passenger's personally identifiable information to any other person, except under certain limited circumstances.\n\n4.  A participating driver, or a TNC on the driver's behalf, is subject to certain insurance requirements; a TNC is required to make certain disclosures to its participating drivers about insurance; and automobile insurers are permitted to exclude coverage for TNC services.\n\n5.  In addition to other nondiscrimination and accessibility requirements, a TNC must have in place a policy of nondiscrimination on the basis of destination, race, color, national origin, religious belief or affiliation, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, or gender identity with respect to passengers and prospective passengers.\n\n6.  A TNC must have in place a \"zero tolerance\" policy prohibiting participating drivers from using alcohol, or any other intoxicant that may render the participating driver incapable of safely driving, while the participating driver is engaged in TNC services or is logged on to the TNC's digital network.\n\n7.  Before a TNC allows an individual to be a participating driver, the TNC must require the individual to submit a driver application that includes, among other things, the individual's driving history and proof of registration and a copy of the automobile liability insurance policy for each motor vehicle the individual will use to provide TNC services; conduct, or have a third party conduct a criminal background check for the individual; and obtain and review a driving history research report for the individual.\n\n8.  A TNC is prohibited from allowing certain individuals to be participating drivers for the TNC, including an individual who has been convicted of certain moving violations within the previous three years, who has been convicted of certain crimes within the previous seven years, or whose information appears on the state or national sex offender registry.\n\n9.  A TNC is required to maintain all records concerning a participating driver for at least one year after the participating driver ceases to engage in TNC services for the TNC, and a TNC must maintain passenger trip records for at least one year after the trip.\n\nThe bill authorizes DSPS to conduct investigations and hold hearings to determine whether a violation of the bill's provisions, a related rule promulgated by DSPS, or any other law that substantially relates to the operation of a TNC or to TNC services has occurred.  The bill further authorizes DSPS to discipline a licensed TNC, and any person who violates the bill's provisions or a related rule promulgated by DSPS may be subject to a fine not to exceed $1,000.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB106,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  194.01 (1) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB106,3,92\n194.01 (1)  \"Common motor carrier\" means any person who holds himself or 3herself out to the public as willing to undertake for hire to transport passengers or 4property by motor vehicle upon the public highways.

The authority is governed by a board of directors consisting of the commissioner of insurance (commissioner), the secretary of employee trust funds, the director of the state Medical Assistance program, the executive directors of the Wisconsin Collaborative for Healthcare Quality and the Wisconsin Health Information Organization, and the following members who are nominated by the governor, and with the advice and consent of the senate appointed, for three-year terms: a member in good-standing of the American Academy of Actuaries, a health economist, an employee benefits specialist, a representative of small employers, a representative of an organization that represents consumer interests, a representative of organized labor, and an individual with experience in health care administration.  The chairperson of the board is the commissioner.  The board must appoint an executive director of the authority.  The executive director must, among other duties, supervise the administrative affairs and general management and operation of the authority, employ professional and clerical staff, as necessary, and prepare the authority's annual budget.\n\nThe authority is not a state agency, so numerous laws that apply to state agencies do not apply to the authority.  However, the authority is treated like a state agency in the following ways, among others: it is subject to auditing by the Legislative Audit Bureau; it is subject to open meeting and open records laws; and it is exempt from property tax, income tax, and sales and uses taxes.  The authority has powers, including adopting bylaws and policies and procedures for the regulation of its affairs and conduct of its business; hiring employees; incurring debt; suing and being sued in its own name; and executing contracts.  The bill establishes a process that the authority must use when it contracts for professional services.  Under the bill, the authority is subject to civil liability for its acts or omissions except that the maximum amount recoverable in a civil action against the authority is $100,000. However, a member of the authority's board of directors, the authority's executive director, or an authority employee is exempt from civil liability unless the member, director, or employee acted with willful misconduct or in intentional violation of the law.  The bill also imposes restrictions on board members and the authority's executive director pertaining to conflicts of interest and requires board members and the executive director to file financial disclosures.\n\nHealth benefit exchange\n\nUnder the bill, the authority must establish and operate a Wisconsin Health Benefit Exchange in this state, must make qualified health plans, with effective dates on or before January 1, 2016, available to qualified individuals and qualified employers, and must seek federal grants and other funding for the purpose of the exchange.  A qualified health plan is defined in the bill, generally, as a health benefit plan that covers the costs of health care services and that meets the certification criteria described in the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA).  A qualified individual is defined in the bill, generally, as a citizen or national of the United States, or an alien lawfully present in the United States, who is not imprisoned in a correctional facility and who resides in this state.  A qualified employer is defined in the bill, generally, as an employer with not more than 100 employees (small employer) that either:  1) has its principal place of business in this state and elects to provide coverage to all of its eligible employees, wherever employed, through the small business health options program component of the exchange (SHOP Exchange) established by the authority; or 2) elects to provide coverage through the SHOP Exchange to all of its eligible employees who are principally employed in this state.\n\nOnly health benefit plans that are certified by the authority as qualified health plans may be offered through the exchange.  To be certified as a qualified health plan, a health benefit plan must provide the essential health benefits package described in PPACA, its premium rates and contract language must have been filed with and not disapproved by the commissioner, it must provide at least a bronze level of coverage, as determined by the authority in accordance with criteria developed by the secretary of the federal Department of Health and Human Services (federal secretary), its cost-sharing must not exceed limits established in PPACA, the insurer offering it must meet specified criteria, and the authority must determine that making the plan available through the exchange is in the interest of qualified individuals and qualified employers in this state.\n\nThe authority must assign a rating to, and determine the level of coverage of, each qualified health plan offered through the exchange.  The levels of coverage under PPACA are bronze, silver, gold, and platinum, and are based on what percentage of the full actuarial value of the benefits provided under the plan the benefits under the plan provides.  An eligible employee of a qualified employer that provides coverage through the SHOP Exchange may enroll in any qualified health plan offered through the SHOP Exchange at the level of coverage specified by his or her employer.\n\nAfter the exchange begins operating, no insurer may offer or issue health benefit plan coverage in this state to an individual or a small employer except through the exchange.  Although any insurer that is authorized to do business in this state in one or more lines of insurance that includes health insurance may offer qualified health plans through the exchange, a health benefit plan may not be certified as a qualified health plan unless the insurer that offers it, among other things, is in good standing, charges the same premium for the plan regardless of whether it is offered directly by the insurer or through an insurance intermediary, offers through the exchange at least one qualified health plan in each of the silver and gold levels of coverage, and complies with regulations of the federal secretary and any other requirements established by the authority.  In addition, any insurer that seeks certification of a health benefit plan as a qualified health plan must provide a justification for any premium increase; must make specified information available to the public, such as data on enrollment and on the number of claims denied, claims payment policies and practices, and financial disclosures; and must permit individuals enrolled in the plan to learn the amount that an individual would be responsible for paying toward the cost of a specific item or service.\n\nAn insurer that offers coverage through the exchange must establish a toll-free hotline for providing information to enrollees and must pay a commission, determined by the authority, to an insurance intermediary who enrolls a qualified individual or employees of a qualified employer in a qualified health plan offered by the insurer through the exchange.  For determining premiums, an insurer that offers coverage through the exchange may pool together all individuals and employees with coverage under all of the plans issued by the insurer through the exchange.  To pay administrative expenses of the exchange, the authority may impose on each insurer offering plans through the exchange a surcharge that is based on the insurer's total premium or flat dollar amount per enrollee collected through the exchange.\n\nThe bill sets out numerous responsibilities for the authority with respect to the exchange.  In addition to the administrative duties related to certifying and rating health benefit plans and enrolling qualified individuals and qualified employers, the authority must provide for the operation of a toll-free telephone hotline to respond to requests for assistance; establish an appeals process; establish and operate a service center to provide information; publicize the exchange; maintain an Internet site with comparative information about qualified health plans; screen applicants for eligibility for Medical Assistance (MA) and, if eligible, assist them to enroll in MA; select, and award grants to, entities to serve as navigators for conducting public education activities and distributing information about, and facilitating enrollment in, qualified health plans; review the rate of premium growth within the exchange and outside of the exchange; and develop recommendations on whether qualified employers should be limited to small employers.  The authority may establish risk adjustment mechanisms for the exchange, contract with a third-party administrator for services on behalf of the exchange, and establish sub-exchanges or other exchanges provided for under federal law.  The authority must keep an accounting of all exchange-related activities and receipts and expenditures and annually submit a report of the accounting to the federal secretary, the governor, the commissioner, and the legislature.\n\nThe commissioner may promulgate rules related to the implementation of the exchange and must develop a standard application form for use in the exchange.\n\n\nBecause this bill creates a new crime or revises a penalty for an existing crime, the Joint Review Committee on Criminal Penalties may be requested to prepare a report concerning the proposed penalty and the costs or savings that are likely to result if the bill is enacted.\n\nFor further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB107,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  1.12 (1) (b) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB107,5,32\n1.12 (1) (b)  \"State agency\" means an office, department, agency, institution of 3higher education, the legislature, a legislative service agency, the courts, a judicial 4branch agency, an association, society, or other body in state government that is 1created or authorized to be created by the constitution or by law, for which 2appropriations are made by law, excluding the Badger Health Benefit Authority and 3the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation.\nSB107,2\n\n\n4Section \n2.  13.172 (1) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB107,5,105\n13.172 (1)  In this section, \"agency\" means an office, department, agency, 6institution of higher education, association, society, or other body in state 7government created or authorized to be created by the constitution or any law, that 8is entitled to expend moneys appropriated by law, including the legislature and the 9courts, and any authority created in subch.

Under the bill, a new business is a business organized in this state no earlier than five years before the business applies for an entrepreneurial assistance grant.  Additionally, if WEDC awards an entrepreneurial assistance grant to three or more businesses to fund internships for students enrolled at a single institution of higher education, and the institution develops a program to support internships funded by these grants, WEDC may award an additional grant of up to $25,000 to the institution.  Finally, this bill requires WEDC to allocate at least $125,000 in each fiscal year to fund grants authorized under the bill and to submit a report on the effectiveness of those grants to the legislature no later than February 1, 2019.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB112,1\n\n\n3Section \n1.  238.137 of the statutes is created to read:\nSB112,2,1\n1238.137  Entrepreneurial assistance grants.

Brooks, Tittl, Loudenbeck, Ripp, Kolste, Billings, Murphy, Kulp, Rohrkaste, Doyle, Allen, Bernier, Danou, Thiesfeldt, Novak, Krug, Murtha and Macco.

Current law defines a shoreland to be an area within a specified distance from the edge of a navigable water.\n\nCurrent law also provides that if an existing town ordinance relating to shorelands is more restrictive than a later enacted county shoreland zoning ordinance, the town ordinance remains in effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise.\n\nIn Hegwood v. Town of Eagle Zoning Board of Appeals, 2013 WI App 118, N.W. 2d 111, the Wisconsin Appellate Court held that a town has no authority to regulate shorelands unless the town enacted an ordinance before a county shoreland zoning ordinance was enacted regulating the same shorelands.  The court held that in that case, the town ordinance continues in effect only to the extent that it is more restrictive than the later enacted county shoreland zoning ordinance.\n\nThis bill provides that a town, with certain exceptions, may enact a zoning ordinance, consistent with its existing zoning authority, that applies in shorelands.  The bill also specifies that a town zoning ordinance may not impose restrictions or requirements in shorelands with respect to matters regulated by a county shoreland ordinance affecting the same shorelands.  The bill does not change current law which provides that a town ordinance that is in effect before a county shoreland zoning ordinance takes effect and that is more restrictive than the county shoreland zoning ordinance, continues to apply to the extent of the greater restrictions.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB113,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  60.61 (3r) of the statutes is created to read:\nSB113,2,32\n60.61 (3r)  Zoning in shorelands.

DFI also reviews and files charters, articles of incorporation, and other documents of business organizations and registers and oversees the mortgage banking industry.  Finally, DFI oversees Uniform Commercial Code filings in this state and administers the Wisconsin Consumer Act.\n\nThis bill transfers all of the functions of DFI, including functions of the Division of Banking and the Division of Securities, to the Department of Financial Institutions and Professional Standards (DFIPS).  Additionally, this bill transfers the Office of Credit Unions to DFIPS.\n\nUnder current law, the Department of Administration (DOA) administers disabled veteran-owned business certifications, woman-owned business certifications, and minority business certifications that are designed to encourage the creation and foster the growth of Wisconsin businesses owned by women, disabled veterans, or minorities.  A business that qualifies for and maintains one of those certifications may be eligible to receive certain advantages bidding on public projects and other benefits.  This bill transfers the administration of those certifications to DFIPS.\n\nAlso under current law, there is attached to DOA a Small Business Regulatory Review Board, which is tasked with reviewing and making reports concerning proposed administrative rules that may have an economic impact on small businesses.  The Small Business Regulatory Review Board is advised by the Office of Business Development, which is also attached to DOA.  The bill transfers the Small Business Regulatory Review Board and the Office of Business Development from DOA to DFIPS.\n\neducation\n\nUnder current law, the Educational Approval Board (EAB), which is attached to the Technical College System Board, inspects and approves private trade, correspondence, business, and technical schools.  The EAB also issues permits to, and regulates, persons who solicit students for enrollment in these schools.  The EAB also performs certain functions related to the preservation of student records at closed schools.  The EAB also has certain consumer protection functions related to deceptive practices involving institutions of higher education.\n\nThis bill eliminates the EAB.  The bill eliminates some current functions of the EAB, transfers some functions to DFIPS, and transfers some functions to the Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection (DATCP).  Under the bill, DFIPS must, upon application, issue written authorization to a proprietary school if the school meets requirements established by rule by DFIPS.  One requirement is that the school must have accreditation recognized by the federal Department of Education or by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation.  The EAB's record preservation functions are also transferred to DFIPS.  Certain consumer protection functions of the EAB are transferred to DATCP.\n\nhealth and human services\n\nThe bill transfers oversight of tattooing, body piercing, and tanning from the Department of Health Services, which currently regulates those areas, to DFIPS.\n\nSafety and professional services\n\nUnder current law, the Department of Safety and Professional Services (DSPS) and the various boards and councils attached to DSPS regulate professional licensure and buildings and safety in Wisconsin.  This bill eliminates DSPS and transfers all of its functions to DFIPS.  The bill attaches to DFIPS the various boards and councils attached to DSPS under current law, except that the bill transfers the Veterinary Examining Board to DATCP.\n\nUnder current law, DSPS administers the laws regulating private on-site wastewater treatment systems.  Generally, a private on-site wastewater treatment system is a sewage treatment and disposal system serving a single structure with a septic tank and soil absorption field located on the same parcel as the structure.  Current law also requires certain local governmental units to enact ordinances regulating private on-site wastewater treatment systems.\n\nThis bill transfers DSPS's responsibilities with respect to administration of the laws regulating private on-site wastewater treatment systems to the Department of Natural Resources, except that the bill eliminates a grant program for individuals and businesses served by failing private on-site wastewater treatment systems.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB119,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  15.07 (5) (i) of the statutes is repealed.\nSB119,2\n\n2Section \n2.  15.08 (1m) (a) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB119,7,53\n15.08 (1m) (a)  Public members appointed under s. 15.405 15.175 or 15.407 415.177 shall have all the powers and duties of other members except they shall not 5prepare questions for or grade any licensing examinations.\nSB119,3\n\n6Section \n3.  15.08 (1m) (am) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB119,7,137\n15.08 (1m) (am)  Public members appointed under s. \n15.405 15.175 or 15.407 815.177 shall not be, nor ever have been, licensed, certified, registered, or engaged in 9any profession or occupation licensed or otherwise regulated by the board, examining 10board, or examining council to which they are appointed, shall not be married to any 11person so licensed, certified, registered, or engaged, and shall not employ, be 12employed by, or be professionally associated with any person so licensed, certified, 13registered, or engaged.\nSB119,4\n\n1Section \n4.  15.085 (1m) (a) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB119,8,42\n15.085 (1m) (a)  Public members appointed under s. \n15.406 15.176 shall have 3all of the powers and duties of other members except that they shall not prepare 4questions for or grade any licensing examinations.\nSB119,5\n\n5Section \n5.  15.085 (1m) (am) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB119,8,116\n15.085 (1m) (am)  Public members appointed under s. \n15.406 15.176 shall not 7be, nor ever have been, licensed, certified, registered, or engaged in any profession 8or occupation licensed or otherwise regulated by the affiliated credentialing board 9to which they are appointed, shall not be married to any person so licensed, certified, 10registered, or engaged, and shall not employ, be employed by, or be professionally 11associated with any person so licensed, certified, registered, or engaged.\nSB119,6\n\n12Section \n6.  15.105 (32) of the statutes is renumbered 15.142 (18g) and amended 13to read:\nSB119,8,1814\n15.142 (18g)  Office of business development.

Funds for the care of a cemetery lot (lot care funds).\n\n2.  Funds for the care of a mausoleum space (mausoleum care funds).\n\n3.

WEDC may award such a state matching grant if the grant applicant satisfies certain additional conditions, including that the applicant demonstrates to WEDC that it completed any requirements for its Phase I SBIR or STTR federal grant and that it has, in fact, been awarded a Phase II SBIR or STTR federal grant.\n\nWEDC must contract with a person to whom WEDC awards a state matching grant under the bill.  Among other things, the contract must include the amount of the state matching grant and must require that the state matching grant recipient submit a report to WEDC that shows its expenditures of the Phase I or Phase II federal grant, as applicable, as well as its expenditures of the state matching grant.\n\nUnder the bill, WEDC may not award a state matching grant that exceeds the lesser of $50,000 or the amount of the Phase I or Phase II SBIR or STTR federal grant, as applicable.  The bill also limits WEDC's total state matching grant awards per state fiscal year to $300,000.\n\nFor further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB124,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  238.14 of the statutes is created to read:\nSB124,2,3\n2238.14  Grants to recipients of federal grants for research and 3innovation.

An inherent risk of an equine activity is any condition that is an integral part of an equine activity, including the unpredictability of the animal's behavior, the failure of a rider to control an animal, or a collision with an object or another animal.\n\nCurrent law does not extend immunity if a person provides equine equipment that he or she knew or should have known was faulty, if a person provides an equine to a person without making a reasonable effort to determine the person's ability to safely manage the equine, if a person acts in a willful or wanton disregard for the safety of a person or intentionally causes the person's injury or death, or if a person fails to post required safety and warning signs.\n\nUnder this bill, equine-assisted learning and equine-assisted psychotherapy are equine activities for the purpose of civil liability immunity.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB126,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  895.481 (1) (b) 5d. of the statutes is created to read:\nSB126,2,22\n895.481 (1) (b) 5d.

Brooks, Macco, Thiesfeldt, Sanfelippo, A. Ott, Nygren, Tittl, Kremer, Brandtjen, Kapenga, Craig, Skowronski, Weatherston, Knodl, Vorpagel, Allen, Horlacher, Jarchow and Steffen. Referred to Committee on Revenue, Financial Institutions, and Rural Issues.\n\nSB127,1,2\n1An Act to amend 138.056 (2) (intro.) and 138.056 (2) (b); and to create 138.056 2(2m) of the statutes; relating to: variable rate loans.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nUnder current law, a residential mortgage loan is a loan secured by a first lien real estate mortgage on, or equivalent security interest in, a one-family to four-family dwelling that the borrower uses as his or her principal place of residence.  A manufactured home transaction is a consumer credit sale of, or a consumer loan secured by a first lien or equivalent security interest in, a manufactured home or mobile home.  A variable rate loan is a residential mortgage loan or manufactured home transaction the terms of which permit the interest rate to be increased or decreased.\n\nCurrent law imposes various requirements and limitations on variable rate loans, including limitations on adjustments to the interest rate of a variable rate loan.  If interest rate adjustments correspond to an index, the index must be an approved index.  An approved index is an index that is either one of certain specified indexes or is an index readily verifiable by borrowers, beyond the control of an individual lender, and approved by the applicable state regulator, such as the Division of Banking in the Department of Financial Institutions (DFI) or the Office of Credit Unions attached to DFI.  Interest rate adjustments must correspond to upward and downward changes in the approved index, except:  the lender may decrease the interest rate or decline to increase the interest rate at any time; and, the lender may decline to decrease the interest rate if this offsets prior interest rate increases declined by the lender.  Also, interest rate decreases may be limited only if interest rate increases are limited at least to the same extent.\n\nThis bill allows a lender making a variable rate loan based on an approved index to include a lower, discounted initial interest rate.  During the initial interest rate period, provisions of current law related to the approved index do not apply, but they do apply after expiration of the initial interest rate period.  The bill also eliminates the provision that interest rate decreases may be limited only if interest rate increases are limited at least to the same extent.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB127,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  138.056 (2) (intro.) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB127,2,32\n138.056 (2)  Required terms.  (intro.)   A  Except as provided in sub. (2m), a 3variable rate loan contract shall:\nSB127,2\n\n\n4Section \n2.  138.056 (2) (b) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB127,3,45\n138.056 (2) (b)  Use an approved index if it provides for adjustments to the 6interest rate corresponding to an index.  The Subject to sub. (2m), the initial index 7value shall be the most recently available value of the index prior to the date of 8closing of the loan.  The interest rate at adjustment shall reflect the difference, in 9reference to the interest rate of the variable rate loan at the date of closing or, if sub. 10(2m) is applicable, upon expiration of the initial interest rate period, between the 11initial index value and the index value most recently available as of the date notice 12of the interest rate adjustment is mailed under sub. (4) except the lender may 13decrease the interest rate or decline to increase the interest rate at any time.  The 14interest rate shall be decreased to reflect any downward movement of the index 15except to the extent the decrease offsets increases in the index not implemented as 16interest rate increases.  An increase in the index permitting the lender to increase 17the interest rate but declined by the lender for any rate adjustment interval may be 18carried over and applied in succeeding interest rate adjustment intervals to the 19extent the increase is not offset by subsequent decreases in the index.  The variable 1rate loan contract may provide for minimum interest rate change increments which 2shall apply to both increases and decreases.  The variable rate loan contract may 3limit interest rate decreases only if interest rate increases are restricted at least to 4the same extent.\nSB127,3\n\n\n5Section \n3.  138.056 (2m) of the statutes is created to read:\nSB127,3,126\n138.056 (2m)  Discounted initial rate.  A variable rate loan contract may 7include a discounted initial interest rate that is lower than the rate established 8under sub. (2) (b).  Upon expiration of the initial interest rate period, sub. (2) (b) shall 9apply.  For purposes of sub. (2) (b), the initial index value shall be the most recently 10available value of the index immediately prior to the expiration of the initial interest 11rate period.  This subsection applies to variable rate loan contracts entered into on 12or after the effective date of this subsection ....

However, no financial assistance is permitted to be provided under this program after June 30, 1990.  Current law also contains a financial assistance program, administered by DNR, for combined sewer overflow abatement projects.  This program also has not provided financial assistance since 1990.  The types of projects funded under both of these programs are now funded through the clean water fund program.\n\nIn addition, current law establishes a program that provides grants to repair or replace failing private on-site wastewater treatment systems.  This program, initially administered by DNR, is now administered by the Department of Safety and Professional Services (DSPS).\n\nDNR has promulgated administrative rules to administer these three financial assistance programs.  This bill eliminates the administrative rules that implement those programs.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB128,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.

As participating employees, the employees may receive all retirement benefits under the WRS.  The major exceptions for participating employee status include employees who work less than two-thirds time or who are not expected to work longer than a year.\n\nThis bill permits an employer that is not currently a participating employer in the WRS, but which elects to become a participating employer in the WRS after the bill's effective date, to be a participating employer only with respect to employees hired on or after the date on which the employer elects to participate in the WRS.  In other words, an employer may choose not to include its current employees in the WRS.  Any employer that makes such an election shall do so in writing on a form provided by the Department of Employee Trust Funds (DETF).  The bill, however, allows a local government employer to exclude any of its public utility employees who already receive from the employer substantially similar retirement benefits to those provided under the WRS, as determined by DETF.\n\nBecause this bill relates to public employee retirement or pensions, it may be referred to the Joint Survey Committee on Retirement Systems for a report to be printed as an appendix to the bill.\n\nFor further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB134,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  40.21 (7) of the statutes is created to read:\nSB134,2,82\n40.21 (7) (a)  Subject to par.

Referred to Committee on Health and Human Services.\n\nSB136,1,2\n1An Act relating to: a waiver to limit the number of FoodShare replacement 2cards.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nThe federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), known as FoodShare in Wisconsin and formerly known as the Food Stamp Program, provides benefits to eligible low-income households for the purchase of food.  FoodShare is administered by the Department of Health Services (DHS).  The state and the federal government share the cost of administration.  Benefits, which are electronically debited to a Quest card, are paid entirely with federal funds.  Under federal regulations, there is no limit on the number of replacement cards that must be issued to a household for cards that are reported lost, stolen, or damaged.  However, under the federal regulations, a state may opt to require a household member to contact the state agency to provide an explanation if the number of replacement cards requested reaches a threshold that is determined to be excessive.  The threshold for an excessive number of replacement cards may not be less than four within a 12-month period.  The household must be given notice that it has reached the threshold and that it must contact the state agency.  If a household member does not contact the state agency, no replacement card is issued and the case is referred for investigation.\n\nThis bill directs DHS to request a waiver from the secretary of the federal Department of Agriculture, no later than six months after the bill goes into effect, to allow DHS to limit the number of replacement cards that it must issue in a 12-month period to a FoodShare recipient who reports that his or her Quest card has been lost, stolen, damaged, or destroyed to four replacement cards in a 12-month period.  If the waiver is granted and in effect, DHS may limit, to the number authorized under the waiver, the number of replacement cards that it issues to a FoodShare recipient in a 12-month period.\n\nFor further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB136,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.\nNonstatutory provisions.\nSB136,2,22\n(1)  Waiver to limit number of FoodShare replacement cards.\nSB136,2,33\n(a)  In this subsection:\nSB136,2,4\n41.  \"Department\" means the department of health services.\nSB136,2,6\n52.  \"FoodShare recipient\" means an individual or household that is receiving 6benefits under the federal food stamp program under 7 USC 2011 to 2036a.SB136,2,147\n(b)  No later than 6 months after the effective date of this paragraph, the 8department shall request a waiver from the secretary of the federal department of 9agriculture to allow the department to limit the number of replacement benefit cards 10that it must issue in a 12-month period to a FoodShare recipient who reports that 11his or her electronic benefit card has been lost, stolen, damaged, or destroyed to 4 12replacement cards.

Legal notices are generally published in a newspaper likely to give notice in the area or to the persons affected.  Current law also allows certain municipalities to opt to post certain legal notices in lieu of publishing the notices in a newspaper, if the municipality meets statutory requirements regarding timing and placement of the notices.\n\nUnder current law, the municipality must post the notice in at least three public places likely to give notice to persons affected, and must post a notice that would be published before the act or event requiring notice no later than the time specified for the first newspaper publication or, if the notice would be published after the act or event requiring notice, must post the notice within one week after the act or event.\n\nUnder this bill, a municipality that opts to post a legal notice in lieu of publication may, instead of posting the notice in three public places, post the notice in one public place and publish the notice on the municipality's Internet site.\n\nFor further information see the local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB137,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  985.01 (7) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB137,2,42\n985.01 (7)  \"Wisconsin newspapers legal notices \nWeb Internet site\" means an 3Internet Web site maintained by Wisconsin newspapers for the purpose of providing 4and maintaining an electronic version of printed and published legal notices.\nSB137,2\n\n\n5Section \n2.  985.02 (2) (a) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB137,2,96\n985.02 (2) (a)  The notice must be posted in at least 3 public places likely to give 7notice to persons affected or must be posted in at least one public place likely to give 8notice to persons affected and placed electronically on an Internet site maintained 9by the municipality.\nSB137,3\n\n\n10Section \n3.  985.02 (2) (b) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB137,2,1311\n985.02 (2) (b)  The notice posted before the act or event requiring notice shall 12be posted and, if applicable, placed electronically, no later than the time specified for 13the first newspaper publication.\nSB137,4\n\n\n14Section \n4.  985.02 (2) (c) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB137,2,1815\n985.02 (2) (c)  The notice posted after the act or event requiring notice shall be 16posted and, if applicable, placed electronically, within one week after the act or event.  17Actions of governing bodies posted after the act or event shall be effective upon 18posting.\nSB137,5\n\n\n19Section \n5.  985.02 (3) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB137,3,3\n1985.02 (3)  The newspaper that publishes a legal notice shall, in addition to 2newspaper publication, place an electronic copy of the legal notice at no additional 3charge on the Wisconsin newspapers legal notice Web \nnotices Internet site.\nSB137,6\n\n\n4Section \n6.  985.08 (1) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB137,3,215\n985.08 (1)  The fee for publishing a legal notice shall be not more than the rate 6issued by the department of administration for the first and subsequent insertions 7per standard line.  The charge for the publication of a facsimile ballot shall be 8computed as if the area occupied by the ballot were set in standard lines.  If a legal 9notice contains tabulated matter, then the fees allowable for the area containing such 10matter shall be increased 50% of the standard line base rate without adjustment for 11circulation premium.  Composed matter shall be interpreted as being tabular when 12it contains 2 or more justifications per line.  The standard line rate shall be reviewed 13annually, the adjustment, if any, to be effective on January 1 of each year to reflect 14the relevant change in costs of the newspaper publishing industry during the 15previous year, as determined by the department of administration in consultation 16with representatives of the daily and weekly newspaper industry of the state.

The federal government will establish and operate an exchange in a state that does not establish its own.  Health insurance offered through the exchange must meet certain federal requirements, including offering the essential health benefits package that is established by the federal Department of Health and Human Services.  Such a health benefit plan is called a qualified health plan (plan) under the ACA.\n\nThis bill requires a insurer that offers plans through an exchange that is operating in this state to provide access on the insurer's Internet site to information, in a clear and understandable form, that will enable consumers shopping for health insurance on the exchange to determine all of the following about the insurer's plans offered through the exchange:  exclusions from coverage and restrictions on use or quantity of covered services or items; any service or item with a cost-sharing requirement that depends on the cost of the service or item; whether a specific prescription drug is covered and any clinical prerequisites or authorization requirements for coverage of a prescription drug; whether specific types of specialists are included, and whether a specific named specialist is included, in the plan's network; the process for appealing a denial of coverage of a service or item; and how the out-of-pocket costs of medications will or will not be applied towards the deductible under the plan.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB138,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  185.983 (1) (intro.) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB138,2,92\n185.983 (1) (intro.)

This bill provides that, in addition to being required to repay those UI benefits and pay an administrative assessment, an individual who commits an act of impersonation is ineligible for UI benefits for a period of seven years if the individual commits another, distinct act of impersonation.\n\nFor further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB140,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  108.04 (11) (br) of the statutes is created to read:\nSB140,2,112\n108.04 (11) (br)  In addition to any ineligibility for benefits resulting from 3concealment as provided in par.

Brooks, Doyle, Edming, Jagler, Johnson, Kahl, Kitchens, Kleefisch, Kolste, Krug, Murphy, Ohnstad, A. Ott, Quinn, Subeck and Zamarripa. Referred to Committee on Judiciary and Public Safety.\n\nSB141,1,4\n1An Act to amend 48.02 (15), 48.21 (5) (e) 1., 938.02 (15) and 938.21 (5) (e) 1. of 2the statutes; relating to: the notification of relatives when a child is removed 3from the custody of the child's parent and placement of a child with a parent of 4a sibling of the child who has custody of the sibling.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nUnder the Children's Code and the Juvenile Justice Code, a child may be placed with a relative when the child is taken into temporary custody, as a disposition, or as a permanent placement.  In addition, in a dispositional order for a child in need of protection or services (CHIPS) proceeding, if there is no less drastic alternative for a child than transferring custody from the parent, the court assigned to exercise jurisdiction under the Children's Code (juvenile court) must consider transferring custody to a relative whenever possible.  The agency preparing a permanency plan for a child must also include in the plan a statement as to the availability of a safe and appropriate placement with a fit and willing relative of the child and, if a decision is made not to place the child with an available relative, a statement as to why placement with the relative is not safe or appropriate.  Finally, before the Department of Children and Families (DCF), a county department of human services or social services (county department), or a child welfare agency may place a child for adoption, that agency must consider the availability of an adoptive placement with a relative of the child who is identified in the permanency plan or otherwise known by that agency.  This bill adds to the relatives with whom a child may be placed under these circumstances a parent of a sibling of the child who has legal custody of that sibling.\n\nUnder current law, when a child is removed from the custody of the child's parent, the juvenile court must order DCF, the county department, or the agency primarily responsible for providing services to the child under the custody order to attempt to locate certain adult relatives of the child and provide them with certain information related to the removal within 30 days after the removal.  That information includes notice that the child has been removed from the custody of the child's parents and an explanation of the options that the adult relative has to participate in the care and placement of the child.  This bill adds to the adult relatives to whom such notice must be provided a parent of a sibling of the child who has legal custody of that sibling.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB141,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  48.02 (15) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB141,2,122\n48.02 (15)  \"Relative\" means a parent, stepparent, brother, sister, stepbrother, 3stepsister, half brother, half sister, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, first cousin, 2nd 4cousin, nephew, niece, uncle, aunt, stepuncle, stepaunt, or any person of a preceding 5generation as denoted by the prefix of grand, great, or great-great, whether by blood, 6marriage, or legal adoption, or the spouse of any person named in this subsection, 7even if the marriage is terminated by death or divorce.

The program is operated under a waiver of federal Medicaid laws, but DHS is required to implement the program regardless of whether the waiver is received from the federal Department of Health and Human Services.  Some of the moneys to administer the Senior Care program derive from the federal government and other moneys come from the state's general purpose revenue (GPR) or from program revenue (PR).  Moneys from GPR are used to pay pharmacies and pharmacists under the Senior Care program.  Program revenue from rebate payments by manufacturers is used to pay pharmacies and pharmacists and PR from payment of enrollment fees is used for administration of Senior Care.  This bill requires DHS to obtain any waiver of federal Medicaid laws necessary to continue administration of Senior Care and to implement any waiver received for the administration of Senior Care.  The bill also requires that any GPR moneys remaining after paying pharmacies and pharmacists, any PR moneys remaining after paying pharmacies and pharmacists and paying for program administration, and any federal moneys remaining be used by DHS for the following purposes: to reduce enrollment costs for seniors participating in Senior Care, to reduce the prices paid by Senior Care enrollees for prescription drugs, and to enlarge the number of prescription drugs available through the Senior Care program.\n\nFor further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB142,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  20.435 (4) (bv) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB142,2,62\n20.435 (4) (bv)  Prescription drug assistance for elderly; aids.

The fair employment law, however, does not authorize DWD to award compensatory or punitive damages to a complainant.\n\nThis bill permits DWD or a person who is alleged or was found to have been discriminated against or subjected to unfair honesty or genetic testing to bring an action in circuit court to recover compensatory and punitive damages caused by the act of discrimination or unfair honesty or genetic testing.  Those damages are in addition to any back pay or other amounts awarded in any administrative proceeding.  The bill, however, does not permit an action for damages to be brought against any local governmental unit or against any employer employing fewer than 15 individuals.\n\nUnder the bill, if the circuit court finds that a defendant has committed an act of discrimination or unfair honesty or genetic testing, the circuit court must order the defendant to pay to the person discriminated against compensatory and punitive damages in an amount that the circuit court finds appropriate, subject to the following limitations:\n\n1.  If the defendant employs 100 or fewer employees, $50,000.\n\n2.  If the defendant employs more than 100 but fewer than 201 employees, $100,000.\n\n3.  If the defendant employs more than 200 but fewer than 501 employees, $200,000.\n\n4.

An applicant for a community school start-up grant must also describe the types of programming the school will provide to improve student learning, strengthen families, and develop a healthier community.  A community school start-up grant is for five years and may be renewed for additional five-year terms.\n\nFinally, the bill requires a recipient of a community school start-up grant to provide an annual report to DPI.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB146,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  20.005 (3) (schedule) of the statutes:  at the appropriate place, insert 2the following amounts for the purposes indicated:\n - See PDF for table SB146,2\n\n\n3Section \n2.  20.255 (2) (cv) of the statutes is created to read:\nSB146,2,54\n20.255 (2) (cv)  Community school start-up grants.

Also under current law, the Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority (WHEDA) is an authority whose primary function is to establish and administer housing programs in Wisconsin, especially housing programs for persons and families of low and moderate income.  Like WEDC, WHEDA is also tasked with developing, implementing, and administering economic development programs in the state.\n\nThis bill merges WEDC and WHEDA into a new, successor authority to be known as the Forward Wisconsin Development Authority (authority).  Under the bill, the authority is governed by a 12-member board of directors (board).  Eight members of the board are public members nominated by the governor and appointed with the advice and consent of the senate to serve four-year terms.  Two members of the board are appointed by the speaker of the assembly, consisting of one majority and one minority party assembly representative, and two members of the board are appointed by the senate majority leader, consisting of one majority and one minority party senator.\n\nThe bill also requires the governor to nominate a chief executive officer and chief operating officer of the authority.  The chief executive officer must be approved by the board and appointed with the advice and consent of the senate.  The chief operating officer is appointed upon approval of the board.  Both officers serve at the pleasure of the governor.  The board may delegate to the chief executive officer and the chief operating officer any powers and duties the board considers proper.\n\nUnder the bill, the board has all powers necessary or convenient to carry out the authority's purposes and other powers specified in the bill.  The bill generally does not alter the existing housing and economic development programs that will be administered by the new authority, except as follows.  Under current law, a recipient of a WEDC grant or loan of at least $100,000 must provide WEDC a schedule of expenditures within 120 days after the end of the fiscal year in which the grant or loan funds were expended and must engage an independent certified public accountant to determine whether the grant or loan funds and any matching cash or in-kind match were expended in accordance with the grant or loan contract.\n\nUnder the bill, any recipient of a grant or loan under an economic development program administered by the authority, regardless of the amount of the grant or loan, must, within the timeframe specified above or at a different time established in policies and procedures approved by the board, submit to the authority an attestation verifying that the grant or loan funds and any matching cash or in-kind match were expended in accordance with the grant or loan contract.  The grant or loan recipient must make the documents supporting the attestation available for inspection by the authority.  Additionally, the bill requires a recipient of an economic development grant or loan of at least $500,000 to engage an independent certified public accountant to determine whether the grant or loan funds and any matching cash or in-kind match were expended in accordance with the grant or loan contract.

This bill changes the time limit for initiating a civil action to two years in those cases in which the death is caused by or arising from an accident involving a motor vehicle covered by a motor vehicle insurance policy.\n\nFinally, current law requires a person seeking damages for an injury to real or personal property to initiate a civil action within six years after the cause of action accrues.  This bill changes the time limit for initiating such a civil action to three years.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB149,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  893.43 of the statutes is renumbered 893.43 (1) and amended to 2read:\nSB149,2,63\n893.43 (1)  An Except as provided in sub.

Current law requires an abandoned vehicle to be impounded until claimed or disposed of.  If an authorized municipal or county representative determines that the cost of towing and storage in impoundment exceeds the abandoned vehicle's value, the municipality or county may junk or sell that abandoned vehicle under certain conditions.  This bill allows the municipality or county to donate that abandoned vehicle as well as junk or sell it.  If an abandoned vehicle is impounded, current law allows the municipality or county to dispose of an unclaimed impounded vehicle by sealed bid or auction sale as provided by ordinance.  If no acceptable bid is received, the municipality or county may readvertise the sale, adjourn the sale, sell the impounded vehicle at a private sale, or junk the impounded vehicle.  This bill allows the municipality or county to donate to a nonprofit organization an unclaimed impounded vehicle, either in lieu of the sale or if no acceptable bid is received.\n\nAlso, under current law, if a vehicle is seized and forfeited due to the commission of a crime, the law enforcement agency that seizes the vehicle may retain it for official use or sell it.  This bill allows the law enforcement agency to also donate the vehicle to a nonprofit organization.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB153,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  45.095 of the statutes is created to read:\nSB153,2,6\n245.095  Donation of abandoned or seized vehicles.

A restriction imposed under this authority is generally indicated on the front side of the licensee's operator's license.  When an operator's license is subject to lengthy special restrictions or special restrictions that are not described in DOT's standard codes, DOT issues a separate special restrictions card that describes the restrictions.  This special restrictions card is, in general, treated as a portion of the operator's license document and must be carried with the operator's license when operating a motor vehicle.\n\nUnder this bill, DOT is not required to issue special restrictions cards.\n\nFor further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB157,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  343.03 (3) (a) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB157,2,92\n343.03 (3) (a)  Regular license.  The standard license legend is \"regular\" or a 3readily recognizable abbreviation thereof.

Current law prohibits inattentive driving of a motor vehicle, which means that a driver of a motor vehicle may not be so engaged or occupied as to interfere with the safe driving of the vehicle.  Current law also specifically prohibits a person who holds a probationary license or instruction permit from driving a motor vehicle while using a cellular or other wireless telephone, except to report an emergency.\n\nThis bill specifically prohibits a person from driving a CMV while using a cellular telephone or other wireless telephone, except to report an emergency.\n\n2.  Under current law, a person's operator's license may be cancelled for a variety of reasons.  For example, a license may be cancelled if the Department of Transportation (DOT) finds that the application for the license contained a material false statement or if a license has been altered and returned to DOT for cancellation.\n\nThis bill specifies that the license of a person who secures, or attempts to secure, a license or endorsement by hiring or permitting another to appear in the person's place to take an examination or otherwise gaining or attempting to gain a passing score in an examination by fraud or otherwise obtain a commercial driver license (CDL) or CDL endorsement by fraud may be cancelled by DOT.\n\n3.  Under current law, if DOT has good cause to believe that a licensed operator is not qualified to be licensed, DOT may require the licensee to submit to an examination.  After the examination, DOT may take any necessary action, including cancelling the license or permitting the licensee to retain the license subject to restrictions.\n\nUnder this bill, if DOT receives credible information that a person holding a CDL committed fraud related to the issuance of the CDL, DOT must require the person to submit to an examination.\n\n4.  Under current law, a person licensed to drive a CMV may be disqualified from operating a CMV for several reasons.  Among these, a person may be disqualified upon being convicted of certain traffic-related offenses that are classified as \"serious traffic violations.\"  A person who is convicted of committing two serious traffic violations within a three-year period is disqualified from operating a CMV for 60 days and a person who is convicted of committing three serious traffic violations within a three-year period is disqualified from operating a CMV for 120 days.\n\nUnder this bill, driving a motor vehicle while composing or sending a text message and driving a CMV while using a cellular or other wireless phone are classified as serious traffic violations.\n\nAlso under this bill, a person whose CDL is cancelled because the person secured, or attempted to secure, a license or endorsement by hiring or permitting another to appear in the person's place to take an examination or otherwise gained or attempted to gain a passing score in an examination by fraud or otherwise obtain a CDL or CDL endorsement by fraud, is disqualified from operating a CMV for one year.\n\n5.  Under current law, a person may be issued a CDL that is subject to certain standard restrictions.  Under current law, these standard restrictions are a prohibition from operating a CMV in interstate commerce and a restriction from operating a CMV that is equipped with air brakes.\n\nThis bill adds several standard restrictions that may be included on a CDL.  These restrictions indicate that a person is prohibited from one of the following: operating a CMV equipped with a manual transmission, operating certain large passenger vehicles, operating tractor-trailer CMVs, operating a CMV equipped with full air brakes, or operating any CMV without a medical variance.\n\nThis bill also does all of the following:\n\n1.  Incorporates certain federal regulations regarding the documentation necessary to receive, and restrictions on, a CDL and requires the labeling of certain CDLs as nondomiciled licenses.\n\n2.  Modifies the standards for determining which vehicles are air brake equipped.\n\n3.  Changes the period of an instruction permit to operate CMVs or school buses from 6 months to 180 days.\n\n4.  Modifies the definition of \"tank vehicle\" and limits the operation of tank vehicles by persons holding an instruction permit.\n\n5.  Requires on-site inspections of third-party driver skills testers biennially rather than annually and permits scoring drivers along with the third-party tester during skills tests as an acceptable manner of evaluating the performance of these testers.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB158,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  343.01 (2) (i) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB158,3,112\n343.01 (2) (i)  \"Tank vehicle\" means any commercial motor vehicle that is 3designed to transport a liquid or gaseous materials within  a tank tanks having an 4individual rated capacity of more than 119 gallons and an aggregate rated capacity 5of 1,000 gallons or more that is are either permanently or temporarily attached to the 6commercial motor vehicle or the chassis.

This bill generally prohibits a person from selling or transferring a firearm unless the sale or transfer occurs through a federally licensed firearms dealer and involves a background check of the prospective transferee.  Under this bill, the following are excepted from that prohibition:  a sale or transfer to a firearms dealer, a sale or transfer for which the waiting period for the purchase of a handgun under current law does not apply, a transfer that is by gift, bequest, or inheritance to a family member, or a transfer that is intended to be temporary and that has a purpose that is not illegal.  A person who is convicted of violating the prohibition is guilty of a misdemeanor and must be fined not less than $500 nor more than $10,000, may be imprisoned for not more than nine months, and may not possess a firearm for a period of two years.\n\nFor further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB159,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  20.455 (2) (gr) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB159,2,52\n20.455 (2) (gr)  Handgun \nFirearm purchaser record check \nfee; checks for licenses 3or certifications to carry concealed weapons.

With exceptions, the fees for nonresidents are 150 percent of the fees for residents.  The TCS Board must establish procedures to determine the residence of students attending technical colleges, but statutes specify that certain students must be considered residents of this state, including veterans verified by the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) as being residents for purposes of receiving specified benefits.  Current law also provides for full fee remission at technical colleges for certain resident veterans and qualifying family members under certain circumstances.\n\nThis bill requires technical college districts to charge resident fees to:  1) a veteran living in this state, regardless of whether the veteran is a resident, if the veteran was discharged or released from at least 90 days of active service within the three years before the date of enrollment in the technical college; and 2) the veteran's spouse or child, living in this state, who is eligible for certain federal benefits by virtue of his or her relationship to the veteran.  After a veteran or qualifying spouse or child is enrolled at a technical college, the technical college district must continue to charge resident fees for as long as the veteran or spouse or child is continuously enrolled.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB164,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  38.24 (3) (a) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB164,2,52\n38.24 (3) (a)  For Except as provided in sub.

Referred to Committee on Revenue, Financial Institutions, and Rural Issues.\n\nSB165,1,4\n1An Act to create 16.643, 71.05 (6) (a) 27., 71.05 (6) (a) 28., 71.05 (6) (b) 52. and 271.07 (5) (a) 9. of the statutes; relating to: tax-exempt accounts for qualified 3expenses incurred by individuals with disabilities and granting rule-making 4authority.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nUnder current federal law, states may create a qualified Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) program under which an individual may establish a tax-exempt savings account to pay for qualified expenses, such as education, housing, and transportation costs, for a beneficiary who is an individual with disabilities, as defined under federal law.  The savings accounts are based on, and are similar to, Internal Revenue Code, section 529, college savings programs.\n\nThis bill authorizes the creation of ABLE accounts in this state.  Under the bill, the Department of Administration (DOA) is required to ensure that accounts set up in this state meet all federal requirements, and DOA must implement and administer the program to ensure that amounts deposited into an account are used only to pay for qualified expenses, as defined under federal law.\n\nUnder the bill, an individual may establish an account at a financial institution, contribute to an account, authorize any other person to contribute to such an account, and change the beneficiary to another family member who must be an eligible individual under federal law.  The maximum amount that may be contributed to an account for a particular beneficiary each year is $14,000, and the maximum total amount of contributions that may be made to such an account for that beneficiary is $100,000.  If a beneficiary or account owner incurs costs for qualified expenses and submits a claim to the financial institution at which the account has been established, the financial institution must pay the claim if there are sufficient funds in the account.\n\nAny gain that accumulates in the account is exempt from taxation, and amounts contributed to the account, subject to the annual and lifetime contribution limits, are tax deductible.  In addition, any assets accumulated in the account may not be used to determine a beneficiary's eligibility for various state programs, such as long-term care programs and the family care partnership program.\n\nBecause this bill relates to an exemption from state or local taxes, it may be referred to the Joint Survey Committee on Tax Exemptions for a report to be printed as an appendix to the bill.\n\nFor further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB165,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  16.643 of the statutes is created to read:\nSB165,2,3\n216.643  Support accounts for individuals with disabilities.

Taylor, Young and Zepnick. Referred to Committee on Labor and Government Reform.\n\nSB166,1,3\n1An Act to amend 111.31 (1), 111.31 (2), 111.31 (3) and 111.321; and to create 2111.32 (7g) and 111.353 of the statutes; relating to: employment 3discrimination based on employment status.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nCurrent law prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of age, race, creed, color, disability, marital status, sex, national origin, ancestry, sexual orientation, arrest or conviction record, military service, use or nonuse of a lawful product off the employer's premises during nonworking hours, or declining to attend a meeting or to participate in any communication about religious or political matters.  Current law specifies that it is an act of employment discrimination to:  1) refuse to hire or employ an individual because of any of those bases; or 2) print or circulate or cause to be printed or circulated any statement, advertisement, or publication, use any form of application for employment, or make any inquiry in connection with prospective employment that implies or expresses any discrimination because of any of those bases.\n\nThis bill prohibits employment discrimination based on employment status, which the bill defines as the status of being employed or unemployed.  The bill specifies that employment discrimination because of employment status includes an employer, employment agency, or other person:  1) refusing to hire or employ an individual because the individual is currently unemployed; and 2) printing or circulating or causing to be printed or circulated any statement, advertisement, or publication, using any form of application for employment, or making any inquiry in connection with prospective employment that states or suggests that the qualifications for a job include currently being employed, that the employer, employment agency, or other person will not consider or review an application for employment submitted by an individual who is currently unemployed, or that the employer, employment agency, or other person will only consider or review an application for employment submitted by an individual who is currently employed.\n\nThe bill, however, provides that it is not employment discrimination because of employment status for an employer, employment agency, or other person to print or circulate or cause to be printed or circulated any statement, advertisement, or publication or to use any form of application for employment that sets forth any bona fide occupational qualifications for a job, including the holding of a professional or occupational credential or the possession of a minimum level of education, training, or experience, or that states that only individuals who are currently employed by the employer, employment agency, or other person will be considered for a job.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB166,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  111.31 (1) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB166,3,42\n111.31 (1)  The legislature finds that the practice of unfair discrimination in 3employment against properly qualified individuals by reason of their age, race, 4creed, color, disability, marital status, sex, national origin, ancestry, sexual 5orientation, arrest record, conviction record, employment status, military service, 6use or nonuse of lawful products off the employer's premises during nonworking 7hours, or declining to attend a meeting or to participate in any communication about 8religious matters or political matters, substantially and adversely affects the general 9welfare of the state.  Employers, labor organizations, employment agencies, and 10licensing agencies that deny employment opportunities and discriminate in 11employment against properly qualified individuals solely because of their age, race, 12creed, color, disability, marital status, sex, national origin, ancestry, sexual 13orientation, arrest record, conviction record, employment status, military service, 1use or nonuse of lawful products off the employer's premises during nonworking 2hours, or declining to attend a meeting or to participate in any communication about 3religious matters or political matters, deprive those individuals of the earnings that 4are necessary to maintain a just and decent standard of living.\nSB166,2\n\n\n5Section \n2.  111.31 (2) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB166,3,186\n111.31 (2)  It is the intent of the legislature to protect by law the rights of all 7individuals to obtain gainful employment and to enjoy privileges free from 8employment discrimination because of age, race, creed, color, disability, marital 9status, sex, national origin, ancestry, sexual orientation, arrest record, conviction 10record, employment status, military service, use or nonuse of lawful products off the 11employer's premises during nonworking hours, or declining to attend a meeting or 12to participate in any communication about religious matters or political matters, and 13to encourage the full, nondiscriminatory utilization of the productive resources of the 14state to the benefit of the state, the family, and all the people of the state.  It is the 15intent of the legislature in promulgating this subchapter to encourage employers to 16evaluate an employee or applicant for employment based upon the individual 17qualifications of the employee or applicant rather than upon a particular class to 18which the individual may belong.\nSB166,3\n\n\n19Section \n3.  111.31 (3) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB166,4,520\n111.31 (3)  In the interpretation and application of this subchapter, and 21otherwise, it is declared to be the public policy of the state to encourage and foster 22to the fullest extent practicable the employment of all properly qualified individuals 23regardless of age, race, creed, color, disability, marital status, sex, national origin, 24ancestry, sexual orientation, arrest record, conviction record, employment status, 25military service, use or nonuse of lawful products off the employer's premises during 1nonworking hours, or declining to attend a meeting or to participate in any 2communication about religious matters or political matters.  Nothing in this 3subsection requires an affirmative action program to correct an imbalance in the 4work force.

Larson and Harris Dodd, cosponsored by Representatives Barnes, Johnson, Sargent, Goyke, Zamarripa, C. Taylor, Berceau, Pope, Danou, Hesselbein, Brostoff, Ohnstad, Bowen and Sinicki. Referred to Committee on Judiciary and Public Safety.\n\nSB167,1,6\n1An Act to renumber 961.41 (1q); to renumber and amend 961.41 (1) (h) 1.; 2to amend 59.54 (25) (a) (intro.), 66.0107 (1) (bm), 961.41 (1m) (h) 1., 961.41 (1r), 3961.41 (3g) (e) and 961.46; to repeal and recreate 961.41 (1q) (title); and to 4create 961.41 (1) (h) 1g. and 961.41 (1q) (b) and (c) of the statutes; relating to: 5possession of 25 grams or less of marijuana and distribution and delivery of 6marijuana.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nCurrent law prohibits a person from possessing or attempting to possess; possessing with the intent to manufacture, distribute, or deliver; and manufacturing, distributing, or delivering marijuana.  The penalties vary based on the amount of marijuana or plants involved or the number of previous controlled-substance convictions the person has.  Current law also allows local governments to enact ordinances prohibiting the possession of marijuana.\n\nThis bill eliminates 1) the penalty for possession of marijuana if the amount of marijuana involved is no more than 25 grams; 2) the penalty for manufacturing or for possessing with the intent to manufacture, distribute, or deliver if the amount of marijuana involved is no more than 25 grams or the number of plants involved is no more than two; and 3) the penalty for distributing or delivering marijuana if the amount of marijuana involved is no more than 25 grams or the number of plants involved is no more than two.  The bill retains the current-law penalty for distributing or delivering any amount of marijuana to a person who is no more than 17 years of age (minor) by a person who is at least three years older than the minor.  This bill limits local governments to enacting ordinances prohibiting only the possession of more than 25 grams of marijuana.\n\nThe bill also prohibits establishing probable cause that a person is violating the prohibition against possessing more than 25 grams of marijuana by an odor of marijuana or by the possession of not more than 25 grams of marijuana.\n\nCurrent law requires that, when determining the weight of controlled substances, the weight includes the weight of the controlled substance together with any compound, mixture, or other substance mixed or combined with the controlled substance.  Under this bill, when determining the amount of tetrahydrocannabinols, only the weight of the marijuana may be considered.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB167,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  59.54 (25) (a) (intro.) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB167,2,102\n59.54 (25) (a) (intro.)

Generally, that procedure consists of the following steps:\n\n1.  The agency planning to promulgate the rule prepares a statement of the scope of the proposed rule (scope statement), which must be approved by the governor and the agency head before any state employee or official may perform any activity in connection with the drafting of the proposed rule.\n\n2.  The agency drafts the proposed rule, together with an economic impact analysis, plain-language analysis, and fiscal estimate for the proposed rule, and submits those materials to the Legislative Council Staff for review.  The agency must also submit a proposed rule that may have an economic impact on small businesses to the Small Business Regulatory Review Board (SBRRB), which must determine whether the proposed rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small businesses and may make certain other recommendations.\n\n3.  Subject to certain exceptions, the agency holds a public hearing on the proposed rule.\n\n4.  The final draft of the proposed rule is submitted to the governor for approval who, in his or her discretion, may approve or reject the proposed rule.\n\n5.  The final draft of the proposed rule, together with the economic impact analysis, plain-language analysis, and fiscal estimate for the proposed rule, are submitted to the legislature for review by one standing committee in each house and by the Joint Committee for Review of Administrative Rules (JCRAR).\n\n6.  The proposed rule is filed with the Legislative Reference Bureau (LRB) for publication in the Wisconsin Administrative Register (register), and, subject to certain exceptions, the rule becomes effective on the first day of the first month beginning after publication.\n\nEmergency rules\n\nUnder current law, an agency may promulgate a rule as an emergency rule without complying with the notice, hearing, and publication requirements for permanent rules if preservation of the public peace, health, safety, or welfare necessitates putting the rule into effect prior to the time it would take effect if the agency complied with the requirements for permanent rules.  An agency must prepare, and obtain approval of, scope statements for emergency rules in the same manner as for permanent rules and must obtain final approval of emergency rules by the governor.  In addition, an agency must submit a copy of an emergency rule it promulgates to the SBRRB, which must determine whether it will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small businesses and make certain other recommendations.\n\nAn emergency rule may only remain in effect for 150 days, except that, at the request of an agency, JCRAR may extend the effective period for an emergency rule for one or more periods of up to 60 days each, not to exceed a total of 120 additional days beyond the 150-day period.\n\nThe bill\n\nThe bill makes various changes regarding the rule-making procedures established under current law.  Significant changes regarding those procedures are described below.\n\nRole of Office of Business Development and Small Business Regulatory Review Board; impacts on small businesses\n\nThe bill requires scope statements for proposed rules, and proposed rules in final draft form, to be submitted to OBD instead of to the governor.  Following either submission, the bill requires the OBD to make a determination as to the agency's authority to promulgate the proposed rule and report its determination to the governor, who may then approve or reject the statement of scope or proposed rule as under current law.\n\nThe bill also requires proposed rules that under current law must be submitted to the SBRRB to instead be submitted to the OBD.  Following the submission, the OBD must make a determination as to whether the proposed rule may have an economic impact on small businesses, and if the OBD so determines, the OBD must submit the proposed rule to the SBRRB for an assessment of the extent of the economic impact.\n\nThe bill makes changes regarding the duties of the SBRRB, including requiring the SBRRB to determine whether a proposed rule will have any economic impact on small businesses.  The bill requires any determination, notice, or report that the SBRRB is required to submit to an agency to be submitted within 45 days after receipt of the proposed rule from the OBD, except that the bill allows the SBRRB and the agency to extend that time by mutual agreement.  The bill also makes other changes regarding the requirements for agencies to complete initial and final regulatory flexibility analyses for proposed rules.\n\nScope statements; preliminary public hearing and comment period on scope statements\n\nCurrent law prohibits an agency head from approving a scope statement until at least ten days after publication of the scope statement in the register.  The bill eliminates that prohibition.\n\nThe bill requires an agency, following approval of a scope statement by the governor, to submit to the LRB a notice of a preliminary public hearing and comment period to allow for public comment and feedback on the scope statement.  The agency must hold the preliminary public hearing no sooner than the third day after publication of the notice in the register.  The preliminary public hearing and comment period under the bill is in addition to the public hearing required under current law for certain rules.\n\nPassage of bill required for certain rules\n\nThe bill provides that if an economic impact analysis, a revised economic impact analysis, or an independent economic impact analysis for a proposed rule indicates that $10 million or more in implementation and compliance costs are reasonably expected to be incurred by or passed along to businesses, local governmental units, and individuals over any two-year period as a result of the proposed rule, the agency proposing the rule must stop work on the proposed rule and do one of the following:\n\n1.  Submit a request for JCRAR to introduce a bill authorizing promulgation of the proposed rule, which JCRAR may introduce in its discretion.  The agency may resume the rule-making procedure for the proposed rule upon enactment of such a bill.\n\n2.  Modify the proposed rule to address the implementation and compliance costs of the proposed rule.  If a revised economic impact analysis, as approved by the secretary of revenue, prepared following the modification indicates that $10 million or more in implementation and compliance costs are not reasonably expected to be incurred by or passed along to businesses, local governmental units, and individuals over a two-year period as a result of the proposed rule, the agency may then resume the rule-making procedure for the proposed rule.\n\n3.  Withdraw the proposed rule.\n\nIndependent economic impact analyses; duties of secretary of revenue\n\nThe bill allows the secretary of revenue, or his or her designee (secretary), or a cochairperson of JCRAR, after an agency submits a copy of an economic impact analysis for a proposed rule to the legislature, but before the proposed rule is submitted to the OBD for final approval, to request that an independent economic impact analysis be prepared for the proposed rule.  If the secretary requests an independent economic impact analysis, the request must be submitted to the Department of Administration (DOA), which must then contract for the preparation of the independent economic impact analysis.  If a cochairperson of JCRAR requests an independent economic impact analysis, the cochairperson must contract for the preparation of the independent economic impact analysis.  The person preparing the independent economic impact analysis must complete the independent economic impact analysis within 60 days after contracting with DOA or the cochairperson and must include most of the same information and analysis that is required for an economic impact analysis prepared by an agency.  If an independent economic impact analysis is requested for a proposed rule, an agency may not submit the proposed rule to the OBD for final approval until the agency receives the completed independent economic impact analysis.\n\nUpon completion of an independent economic impact analysis, the person preparing the analysis may submit a request to DOA or JCRAR, whichever is applicable, for reimbursement of its actual and necessary costs of completing the analysis.  DOA must assess the agency that is promulgating the proposed rule, in the case of a request by the secretary, for the costs of the independent economic impact analysis.  In the case of a request by a cochairperson of JCRAR, the legislature must pay the costs of the independent economic impact analysis.\n\nIn addition, the bill allows JCRAR, when a proposed rule is before JCRAR for final review, to request an independent economic impact analysis for the proposed rule.  If JCRAR requests an independent economic impact analysis at that time, the analysis must similarly be completed within 60 days after JCRAR contracts for the analysis, and JCRAR's review period is extended to the 10th working day following receipt by JCRAR of the completed analysis.\n\nThe bill also requires the secretary to do all of the following:\n\n1.  Review and approve each initial economic impact analysis prepared by an agency, including by reviewing the economic data and analyses used by the agency in preparing the analysis.  If the secretary determines that the agency's analysis does not accurately gauge the economic impact of a proposed rule, the secretary must recommend any modifications to the economic impact analysis that the secretary considers necessary and direct the agency to prepare a revised economic impact analysis for the proposed rule.  An agency may not submit a proposed rule to the OBD for final approval unless the secretary has approved the agency's initial or revised economic impact analysis.  The secretary may approve an economic impact analysis only upon determining that the economic impact analysis accurately gauges the economic impact of the proposed rule.\n\n2.  Provide training to agencies on appropriate data collection and methods of analysis for purposes of preparing economic impact analyses of proposed rules.\n\n3.  Attend JCRAR hearings and present testimony on proposed rules that he or she determines will have an economic impact on specific businesses, business sectors, public utility ratepayers, local governmental units, regulated individuals and entities, or the state's economy as a whole.\n\nApproval of germane modifications to proposed rules\n\nCurrent law permits an agency to make a germane modification to a proposed rule at certain points during the legislative review process.  Under the bill, if an agency makes a germane modification to a proposed rule at any time during the legislative review process, the agency must also submit that modification to the governor for approval.  The governor, in his or her discretion, may approve or reject the modification.  If the governor does not approve the modification, the agency may not promulgate the proposed rule, except that the agency may resubmit the proposed rule to the legislature without the modification.\n\nStatements of policy and interpretations\n\nUnder current law, if JCRAR determines that a statement of policy or an interpretation of a statute meets the definition of a rule, it may direct the agency to promulgate the statement or interpretation as an emergency rule within 30 days after JCRAR's action.\n\nUnder the bill:\n\n1.  The OBD has the same power as JCRAR to direct an agency to promulgate a statement of policy or interpretation of a statute as an emergency rule.\n\n2.  JCRAR or the OBD must, if requiring the agency to promulgate the statement or interpretation as an emergency rule, also require the agency to promulgate the statement or interpretation as a permanent rule, using the permanent rule-making procedure.\n\n3.

Liability for the tax is incurred, generally, by a shipper when the liquor is shipped into this state, except that liability on liquor produced or bottled in this state or imported directly from a foreign country into this state by a person holding a Wisconsin permit is incurred at the time of first sale.\n\nUnder this bill, the liability for the tax imposed on intoxicating liquor is incurred:\n\n1.  By a shipper when the liquor is shipped into this state.\n\n2.  By a person holding a Wisconsin permit when the liquor is received into this state or removed from a federal bonded premise, whichever is later, if it is imported directly from a foreign country into this state by a Wisconsin permittee.\n\n3.  By a Wisconsin winery, manufacturer, or rectifier when intoxicating liquor is removed from a federal bonded premise, if it is produced, bottled, manufactured, or rectified in this state by a Wisconsin winery, manufacturer, or rectifier.\n\n4.  By a Wisconsin rectifier at the time of first sale, if the rectifier had more than 50 percent of its previous calendar year's sales of intoxicating liquor sold outside Wisconsin.\n\nThe bill defines \"first sale\" as the first sale of finished, nonbulk, intoxicating liquor, packaged in containers suitable for sale to consumers or to retailers or other persons holding valid permits.\n\nUnder current law, when intoxicating liquor is stored in an alcohol beverage warehouse by a manufacturer or rectifier as a pledge, it is not necessary to affix front labels to the containers until the liquor is sold or removed from the warehouse.  When it becomes necessary for a pledgee to sell the liquor in good faith pursuant to the terms of the pledge, it must be sold to a manufacturer, rectifier, or wholesaler for the purpose of affixing front labels to the containers.  The sales are then reported to the Department of Revenue.\n\nFor further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB169,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  139.01 (2t) of the statutes is created to read:\nSB169,2,42\n139.01 (2t)  \"First sale\" means the first sale of finished, nonbulk, intoxicating 3liquor, packaged in containers suitable for sale to consumers or to retailers or other 4permittees.\nSB169,2\n\n\n5Section \n2.  139.06 (1) (b) of the statutes is renumbered 139.06 (1) (b) (intro.) 6and amended to read:\nSB169,2,87\n139.06 (1) (b) (intro.)

This bill eliminates most of the state entities that were included in DOA's budget request for the 2015-17 fiscal biennium.

The racial impact statement must be prepared by the Joint Review Committee on Criminal Penalties (JRCCP).  Under the bill, JRCCP may obtain the assistance of any agency in the executive branch of state government in preparing the racial impact statement.\n\nThe bill requires that a racial impact statement include an estimate of the number of criminal cases per year that the bill will affect, the impact of the bill on members of racial minority groups, the effect of the bill on the operations of correctional institutions, and any other matter JRCCP considers appropriate.  In preparing the racial impact statement, JRCCP must also issue a finding as to whether the bill has a disparate impact on members of racial minority groups.  The racial impact statement must be printed as an appendix to the bill and distributed in the same manner as amendments.\n\nUnder the bill, if JRCCP finds that a bill will have a disparate impact on members of racial minority groups, the author of the bill must either offer an amendment to the bill to reduce the disparate impact of the bill on members of racial minority groups or provide in writing his or her reasons for advancing the bill without amendment despite the disparate impact of the bill on members of racial minority groups.\n\nFinally, under the bill, no house of the legislature may pass a bill that creates a new crime, modifies an existing crime, or modifies the penalty for an existing crime without a racial impact statement and without any applicable actions required of the bill's author.\n\nFor further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB172,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  13.0995 of the statutes is created to read:\nSB172,2,4\n213.0995  Racial impact statements.

Referred to Committee on Health and Human Services.\n\nSB174,1,3\n1An Act to amend 49.45 (23) (a) and 49.471 (4) (a) 4. b.; and to create 49.471 (1) 2(cr) and 49.471 (4g) of the statutes; \nrelating to: Medicaid expansion and 3eligibility for BadgerCare Plus and BadgerCare Plus Core.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nCurrently, the Department of Health Services (DHS) administers the Medical Assistance (MA) program, which is a joint federal and state program that provides health services to individuals who have limited financial resources.  Some services are provided through programs that operate under a waiver of federal Medicaid laws, including services provided through the BadgerCare Plus (BC+) and BadgerCare Plus Core (BC+ Core) programs.\n\nUnder current law, certain parents and caretaker relatives with incomes of not more than 100 percent of the federal poverty line (FPL), before a 5 percent income disregard is applied, are eligible for BC+ benefits.  Under current law, adults who are under age 65, who have family incomes that do not exceed 100 percent of the FPL, before a 5 percent income disregard is applied, and who are not otherwise eligible for MA, including BC+ (childless adults), are eligible for benefits under BC+ Core.\n\nThis bill changes the family income eligibility level to up to 133 percent of the FPL for parents and caretaker relatives under BC+ and for childless adults under BC+ Core.  The federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act allows a state to receive an enhanced federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) payment for providing benefits to certain individuals through a state's MA program.  The bill requires DHS to comply with all federal requirements and to request any amendment to the state MA plan, waiver of Medicaid law, or other federal approval necessary to qualify for the highest available enhanced FMAP for parents and caretaker relatives and childless adults eligible for BC+ Core (collectively nonpregnant, nonelderly adults).  If DHS does not qualify for the enhanced FMAP or if the FMAP is reduced, DHS is required to submit to the Joint Committee on Finance (JCF) a fiscal analysis comparing the cost of covering nonpregnant, nonelderly adults under the MA program at up to 133 percent of the FPL to the cost of limiting income eligibility to those adults to up to 100 percent of the FPL.  DHS may reduce income eligibility levels for nonpregnant, nonelderly adults to up to 100 percent of the FPL only if JCF approves.\n\nFor further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB174,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  49.45 (23) (a) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB174,2,92\n49.45 (23) (a)  The department shall request a waiver from the secretary of the 3federal department of health and human services to permit the department to 4conduct a demonstration project to provide health care coverage to adults who are 5under the age of 65, who have family incomes not to exceed 100 133 percent of the 6poverty line before application of the 5 percent income disregard under 42 CFR 7435.603 (d), except as provided in s. 49.471 (4g), and who are not otherwise eligible 8for medical assistance under this subchapter, the Badger Care health care program 9under s. 49.665, or Medicare under 42 USC 1395 et seq.SB174,2\n\n\n10Section \n2.  49.471 (1) (cr) of the statutes is created to read:\nSB174,2,1211\n49.471 (1) (cr)  \"Enhanced federal medical assistance percentage\" means a 12federal medical assistance percentage described under 42 USC 1396d (y) or (z).SB174,3\n\n\n13Section \n3.  49.471 (4) (a) 4. b. of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB174,3,3\n149.471 (4) (a) 4. b.

Referred to Committee on Government Operations and Consumer Protection.\n\nSB176,1,4\n1An Act to renumber and amend 16.754 (2); \nto amend 16.754 (3) (intro.) and 2(a) and 66.0901 (1m) (b); and to create 16.754 (2) (b) and 66.0901 (10) of the 3statutes; relating to: preference in state and local government contracts and 4procurement for materials manufactured in the United States.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nCurrent law generally authorizes the Department of Administration to purchase, or delegate the authority to purchase, all necessary materials and contractual services for all state agencies.  With some exceptions, orders or contracts must be awarded to the lowest bidder.  One such exception requires, if all other factors are substantially equal, the purchasing agent to purchase materials which are mined, produced, manufactured, fabricated, or assembled (manufactured) to the greatest extent in the United States.  Under this bill, with limited exceptions, the state must purchase materials that are manufactured to the greatest extent in the United States, regardless of whether all other factors are substantially equal.  This bill also requires, with limited exceptions, that a contract for a public works or public improvement project must contain a provision that the contractor will use materials that are manufactured in the United States.\n\nGenerally under current law, if a city, village, town, county, school district, sewer district, technical college district, or other local unit of government wishes to let a public contract involving the construction or repair of any public work or building, or the furnishing of supplies or materials, there are a number of bidding requirements that apply to such contracts.  For example, if the value of the contract is above a certain amount, or between certain amounts, certain local units of government must publish a notice in the newspaper before it contracts for the work.  This bill adds another requirement to public contracts entered into by local units of government.  Under this bill, such a public contract must contain a provision that the contractor will use materials that are manufactured in the United States in the performance of the contract.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB176,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  16.754 (2) of the statutes is renumbered 16.754 (2) (a) and amended 2to read:\nSB176,2,53\n16.754 (2) (a)  Notwithstanding s. 16.75 (1) (a) 2., (2), (2m) and (6), when all 4other factors are substantially equal making purchases, the state shall purchase 5materials which are manufactured to the greatest extent in the United States.\nSB176,2\n\n\n6Section \n2.  16.754 (2) (b) of the statutes is created to read:\nSB176,2,107\n16.754 (2) (b)  Any contract entered into by the state for the construction, repair, 8or modification of a public works or public improvement project must contain a 9provision that the contractor will use materials that are manufactured in the United 10States in the performance of the contract.\nSB176,3\n\n\n11Section \n3.  16.754 (3) (intro.) and (a) of the statutes are amended to read:\nSB176,3,212\n16.754 (3)  Exemptions.

Subsection (2) does not apply to 15the purchase of stationery and printing materials.  Subsection (2) does not apply if 16the department determines, under s. 16.75 (1) (a) 2., that the foreign nation or 17subdivision thereof in which the vendor is domiciled does not give preference to 18vendors domiciled in that nation or subdivision in making governmental purchases.  1Subsection (2) does not apply if the department or other person having contracting 2authority in respect to the purchase determines that \nany of the following:\nSB176,3,43\n(a)  The materials are not manufactured in the United States in sufficient or 4reasonably available quantities; or.\nSB176,4\n\n\n5Section \n4.  66.0901 (1m) (b) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB176,3,96\n66.0901 (1m) (b)  Except when necessary to secure federal aid and except as 7provided in sub.

Current law requires the Department of Health Services (DHS) to develop and implement a comprehensive statewide lead poisoning or lead exposure prevention and treatment program that includes lead investigation requirements and lead hazard reduction requirements.  If the presence of lead-bearing paint or a lead hazard is assumed and lead hazard reduction activities are performed in a lead-safe manner, then sampling or testing of dwellings or premises for the presence of lead-bearing paint or a lead hazard is not required under current law.  DHS has promulgated rules regarding lead inspections to test for the presence of lead-based paint and regarding renovation activities on certain dwellings constructed before 1978 and certain buildings constructed before 1978 that are occupied by children.  Under the bill, if the presence of lead-bearing paint of a lead hazard is assumed and a renovation of a dwelling, unit of a dwelling, or premises is performed in a lead-safe manner, any person who performs sampling or testing of a surface in the dwelling or premises relating to that renovation is not required to comply with any requirements established by DHS for a lead inspection.\n\nFor further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB178,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  254.18 (title) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB178,2,3\n2254.18 (title)  Lead hazard reduction in dwellings and premises; 3renovations.\nSB178,2\n\n\n4Section \n2.  254.18 of the statutes is renumbered 254.18 (1).\nSB178,3\n\n\n5Section \n3.  254.18 (2) of the statutes is created to read:\nSB178,2,106\n254.18 (2)  If the presence of lead-bearing paint or a lead hazard is assumed 7and a renovation of a dwelling, unit of a dwelling, or premises is performed in a 8lead-safe manner, any person who performs sampling or testing of a surface in the 9dwelling or premises relating to that renovation is not required to comply with any 10requirements established by the department for a lead inspection.\nSB178,2,1111\n(End)\n            Down\r\n        Down\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n"

Referred to Committee on Health and Human Services.\n\nSB179,1,6\n1An Act to amend 253.10 (3) (c) 1. b. and 253.10 (3) (d) 1.; and to create 69.186 2(1) (hf), 69.186 (1) (k) and (L), 253.10 (2) (dr), 253.10 (3) (c) 2. em. and 253.107 3of the statutes; relating to: requiring a determination of probable 4postfertilization age of an unborn child before abortion, prohibiting abortion of 5an unborn child considered capable of experiencing pain, informed consent, 6abortion reporting, and providing a criminal penalty.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nThis bill prohibits the performance of an abortion, except in a medical emergency, unless the physician performing or inducing the abortion has made a determination of the probable postfertilization age of the unborn child or has relied upon another physician's determination of postfertilization age.  The bill prohibits any person from performing or inducing, or attempting to perform or induce, an abortion when the unborn child is considered to be capable of experiencing pain, unless the woman is undergoing a medical emergency.  Under the bill, the unborn child is capable of experiencing pain if the probable postfertilization age of the unborn child is 20 or more weeks.  When the unborn child is considered capable of experiencing pain and the pregnant woman is undergoing a medical emergency, the bill requires the physician to terminate the pregnancy in the manner that, in reasonable medical judgment, provides the best opportunity for the unborn child to survive.  The bill allows the woman on whom the abortion was performed or attempted, and the father of the unborn child, unless the pregnancy is the result of sexual assault or incest, to bring a claim for damages against a person who violates these limitations and requirements.  A prosecuting attorney may also bring an action for injunctive relief for intentional or reckless violations of the limitations and requirements.  Any person who violates the prohibition against performing, inducing, or attempting to perform or induce an abortion when the unborn child is capable of experiencing pain is guilty of a felony subject to a fine not to exceed $10,000, imprisonment not to exceed three years and six months, or both.\n\nUnder current law, annually, each hospital, clinic, or other facility in which an induced abortion is performed must file with DHS a report for each induced abortion performed in the calendar year.  The report must contain for each patient the state, and county if Wisconsin, of residence; patient number; race; age; marital status; month and year in which the abortion was performed; education; number of weeks since patient's last menstrual period; whether the abortion was chemically or surgically induced or surgically induced following a failed chemical abortion; and any resulting complications.  If the patient is a minor, the report must contain whether consent for the abortion was provided and by whom; and, if consent was not provided, on which basis the abortion was performed.  Under current law, DHS is required to collect the reported information in a manner that ensures anonymity of the patient who obtained the abortion, the health care provider who performed the abortion, and the facility in which the abortion was performed.  Under current law, DHS is required to publish annual demographic summaries of the reported information except what reveals the identity of a patient, provider, or facility.\n\nThe bill requires the hospital, clinic, or other facility to report the probable postfertilization age of the unborn child and whether ultrasound was used to assist in that determination of postfertilization age; or, if the probable postfertilization age of the unborn child was not determined, the nature of the medical emergency.  If the unborn child is considered capable of experiencing pain, the bill requires reporting of the nature of the pregnant woman's medical emergency and a statement of whether the method of abortion used was one that provided the best opportunity for the unborn child's survival.\n\nUnder current law, a woman upon whom an abortion is to be performed or induced must give voluntary and informed written consent to an abortion.  Except in a medical emergency, a woman's consent to an abortion is considered informed only if, at least 24 hours before the abortion is performed or induced, the physician or an assistant has, in person, orally provided the woman with certain information and given to the woman certain written materials.  If the pregnancy is the result of sexual assault or incest, the 24-hour period, but not the provision of information, may be waived or reduced under certain circumstances.  In addition to the current requirement to inform the woman, orally and in writing, of the probable gestational age, the bill requires that the woman be informed, orally and in writing, of the probable postfertilization age of the unborn child and the numerical odds of survival for an unborn child delivered at that probable postfertilization age.  The bill also requires that the woman be orally informed of and provided written materials on the availability of perinatal hospice.\n\nFor further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB179,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  69.186 (1) (hf) of the statutes is created to read:\nSB179,3,62\n69.186 (1) (hf)  The probable postfertilization age of the unborn child, as defined 3in s. 253.107 (1) (c), and whether an ultrasound was used to assist in making the 4determination of postfertilization age of the unborn child, or, if the probable 5postfertilization age of the unborn child was not determined, the nature of the 6medical emergency, as defined in s. 253.10 (2) (d).\nSB179,2\n\n\n7Section \n2.  69.186 (1) (k) and (L) of the statutes are created to read:\nSB179,3,108\n69.186 (1) (k)  If the unborn child is considered to be capable of experiencing 9pain under s. 253.107 (3) (a), the nature of the medical emergency, as defined in s. 10253.10 (2) (d), that the pregnant woman had.\nSB179,3,1711\n(L)  If the unborn child is considered to be capable of experiencing pain under 12s. 253.107 (3) (a), a statement whether the method of abortion used was one that, in 13reasonable medical judgment, provided the best opportunity for the unborn child to 14survive or, if such a method was not used, the basis of the determination that 15termination of the pregnancy in that manner posed a greater risk either of the death 16of the pregnant woman or of the substantial and irreversible physical impairment 17of a major bodily function of the woman than other available methods.\nSB179,3\n\n\n18Section \n3.  253.10 (2) (dr) of the statutes is created to read:\nSB179,4,319\n253.10 (2) (dr)  \"Perinatal hospice\" means comprehensive support that includes 20support from the time of a terminal diagnosis of an unborn child through the birth 21and death of the child and through the postpartum period and may include the 1supportive care of maternal-fetal medical specialists, obstetricians, neonatologists, 2anesthesia specialists, specialty nurses, psychiatrists, psychologists, mental health 3professionals, clergy, social workers, and other professionals.\nSB179,4\n\n\n4Section \n4.  253.10 (3) (c) 1. b. of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB179,4,105\n253.10 (3) (c) 1. b.

The materials shall include 18information, for a woman whose pregnancy is the result of sexual assault or incest, 19on legal protections available to the woman and her child if she wishes to oppose 20establishment of paternity or to terminate the father's parental rights.  The 21materials shall include information on services in the state that are available for 22victims or individuals at risk of domestic abuse.

Except in the case of a medical emergency, 8no physician may perform or induce an abortion, or attempt to perform or induce an 9abortion, unless the physician performing or inducing it has first made a 10determination of the probable postfertilization age of the unborn child or relied upon 11such a determination made by another physician.\nSB179,6,17\n12(3)  Protection of unborn child capable of feeling pain from abortions.  (a)  13No person shall perform or induce or attempt to perform or induce an abortion upon 14a woman when the unborn child is considered capable of experiencing pain unless 15the woman is undergoing a medical emergency.  For purposes of this subsection, an 16unborn child is considered to be capable of experiencing pain if the probable 17postfertilization age of the unborn child is 20 or more weeks.\nSB179,6,2118\n(b)  When the unborn child is considered capable of experiencing pain and the 19pregnant woman is undergoing a medical emergency, the physician shall terminate 20the pregnancy in the manner that, in reasonable medical judgment, provides the best 21opportunity for the unborn child to survive.\nSB179,6,24\n22(4)  Penalty.  Any person who violates sub. (3) (a) is guilty of a Class I felony.  23No penalty may be assessed against a woman upon whom an abortion is performed 24or induced or attempted to be performed or induced.\nSB179,7,4\n1(5)  Civil remedies; injunctions.

If the court determines that a woman's identity should be 6kept confidential, the court shall issue orders to the parties, witnesses, and counsel 7and shall direct the sealing of the record and exclusion of individuals from 8courtrooms or hearing rooms to the extent necessary to safeguard the woman's 9identity from public disclosure.  If the court issues an order to keep a woman's 10identity confidential, the court shall provide written findings explaining why the 11woman's identity should be kept confidential, why the order is essential to that end, 12how the order is narrowly tailored to its purpose, and why no reasonable less 13restrictive alternative exists.\nSB179,8,1714\n(b)  Any person, except for a public official, who brings an action under this 15section shall do so under a pseudonym unless the person obtains the written consent 16of the woman upon whom an abortion was performed or induced, or attempted to be 17performed or induced, in violation of this section.\nSB179,8,1918\n(c)  This section may not be construed to allow the identity of a plaintiff or a 19witness to be concealed from the defendant.\nSB179,8,22\n20(7)  Construction.

The legislature finds that the best current evidence 25confirms:\nSB179,9,3\n1(a)  Pain receptors (unborn child's entire body nociceptors) are present no later 2than 16 weeks after fertilization and nerves link these receptors to the brain's 3thalamus and subcortical plate by no later than 20 weeks.\nSB179,9,54\n(b)  By 8 weeks after fertilization, the unborn child reacts to stimuli that would 5be recognized as painful if applied to an adult human, for example, by recoiling.\nSB179,9,76\n(c)  In the unborn child, application of painful stimuli is associated with 7significant increases in stress hormones known as the stress response.\nSB179,9,108\n(d)  Subjection to painful stimuli is associated with long-term harmful 9neuro-developmental effects, such as altered pain sensitivity and, possibly, 10emotional, behavioral, and learning disabilities later in life.\nSB179,9,1311\n(e)  For the purposes of surgery on unborn children, fetal anesthesia is routinely 12administered and is associated with a decrease in stress hormones compared to their 13level when painful stimuli is applied without the anesthesia.\nSB179,9,2014\n(f)  The position, asserted by some medical experts, that the unborn child is 15incapable of experiencing pain until a point later in pregnancy than 20 weeks after 16fertilization predominately rests on the assumption that the ability to experience 17pain depends on the cerebral cortex and requires nerve connections between the 18thalamus and the cortex.  However, recent medical research and analysis, especially 19since 2007, provides strong evidence for the conclusion that a functioning cortex is 20not necessary to experience pain.\nSB179,9,2221\n(g)  Substantial evidence indicates that children born missing the bulk of the 22cerebral cortex, those with hydraencephaly, nevertheless experience pain.\nSB179,9,2423\n(h)  In adults, stimulation or ablation of the cerebral cortex does not alter pain 24perception while stimulation or ablation of the thalamus does.\nSB179,10,4\n1(i)  Substantial evidence indicates that structures used for pain processing in 2early development differ from those of adults, using different neural elements 3available at specific times during development, such as the subcortical plate, to fulfill 4the rule of pain processing.\nSB179,10,165\n(j)  Consequently, there is substantial medical evidence that an unborn child is 6capable of experiencing pain by 20 weeks after fertilization.  The legislature has the 7constitutional authority to make this judgment.  As the U.S. supreme court has noted 8in Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124, 164-64 (2007): \"The Court has given state and 9federal legislatures wide discretion to pass legislation in areas where there is 10medical and scientific uncertainty...See Marshall v. United States, 414 U.S. 417, 427 11(1974) (`When Congress undertakes to act in areas fraught with medical and 12scientific uncertainties, legislative options must be especially broad.') The law need 13not give abortion doctors unfettered choice in the course of their medical practice, nor 14should it elevate their status above other physicians in the medical community. 15...Medical uncertainty does not foreclose the exercise of legislative power in the 16abortion context any more than it does in other contexts.\"\nSB179,11,217\n(k)  It is the purpose of the state to assert a compelling state interest in 18protecting the lives of unborn children from the stage at which substantial medical 19evidence indicates that they are capable of feeling pain.  In enacting this legislation, 20Wisconsin is not asking the Supreme Court to overturn or replace its holding, first 21articulated in Roe v. Wade and reaffirmed in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern 22Pennsylvania v. Casey, that the state interest in unborn human life, which is 23\"legitimate\" throughout pregnancy, becomes \"compelling\" at viability.  Rather, it 24asserts a separate and independent compelling state interest in unborn human life 1that exists once the unborn child is capable of feeling pain.  It is asserted not in 2replacement of, but in addition, to, the state interest in the viable unborn child.\nSB179,11,93\n(l)  The U.S. supreme court has established that the \"constitutional liberty of 4the woman to have some freedom to terminate her pregnancy...is not so 5unlimited...that from the outset the State cannot show its concern for the life of the 6unborn, and at a later point in fetal development the State's interest in life has 7sufficient force so that the right of the woman to terminate the pregnancy can be 8restricted.\"  Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, 505 U.S. 9833, 869 (1992).\nSB179,11,2510\n(m)  The Supreme Court decision upholding the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban 11Act, Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124 (2007) vindicated the dissenting opinion in 12the earlier decision that had struck down Nebraska's Partial-Birth Abortion Ban 13Act.  That opinion stated, \"[In Casey] We held it was inappropriate for the Judicial 14Branch to provide an exhaustive list of state interests implicated by 15abortion....Casey is premised on the States having an important constitutional role 16in defining their interests in the abortion debate.  It is only with this principle in 17mind that [a state's] interests can be given proper weight. ... States also have an 18interest in forbidding medical procedures which, in the State's reasonable 19determination, might cause the medical profession or society as a whole to become 20insensitive, even disdainful, to life, including life in the human fetus.... A State may 21take measures to ensure the medical profession and its members are viewed as 22healers, sustained by a compassionate and rigorous ethic and cognizant of the 23dignity and value of human life, even life which cannot survive without the 24assistance of others.\"  Stenberg v. Carhart, 530 U.S. 914, 958-59 (2000) (Kennedy, 25J., dissenting.).`\nSB179,9\n\n\n1Section \n9.\nEffective date.\nSB179,12,32\n(1)  This act takes effect on the first day of the 7th month beginning after 3publication.\nSB179,12,44\n(End)\n            Down\r\n        Down\r\n\r\n    \r\n"

The text also includes the May 26, 2015, chief clerk's corrections to the senate bill.\n\nContent of Engrossed 2015 Senate Bill 179\n\nThis bill prohibits the performance of an abortion, except in a medical emergency, unless the physician performing or inducing the abortion has made a determination of the probable postfertilization age of the unborn child or has relied upon another physician's determination of postfertilization age.  The bill prohibits any person from performing or inducing, or attempting to perform or induce, an abortion when the unborn child is considered to be capable of experiencing pain, unless the woman is undergoing a medical emergency.  Under the bill, the unborn child is capable of experiencing pain if the probable postfertilization age of the unborn child is 20 or more weeks.  When the unborn child is considered capable of experiencing pain and the pregnant woman is undergoing a medical emergency, the bill requires the physician to terminate the pregnancy in the manner that, in reasonable medical judgment, provides the best opportunity for the unborn child to survive, unless termination of the pregnancy in that manner poses a greater risk either of the death of the pregnant woman or of the substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function of the woman than other available methods.  The bill allows the woman on whom the abortion was performed or attempted, and the father of the unborn child, unless the pregnancy is the result of sexual assault or incest, to bring a claim for damages against a person who violates these limitations and requirements.  A prosecuting attorney may also bring an action for injunctive relief for intentional or reckless violations of the limitations and requirements.  Any person who violates the prohibition against performing, inducing, or attempting to perform or induce an abortion when the unborn child is capable of experiencing pain is guilty of a felony subject to a fine not to exceed $10,000, imprisonment not to exceed three years and six months, or both.\n\nUnder current law, annually, each hospital, clinic, or other facility in which an induced abortion is performed must file with DHS a report for each induced abortion performed in the calendar year.  The report must contain for each patient the state, and county if Wisconsin, of residence; patient number; race; age; marital status; month and year in which the abortion was performed; education; number of weeks since patient's last menstrual period; whether the abortion was chemically or surgically induced or surgically induced following a failed chemical abortion; and any resulting complications.  If the patient is a minor, the report must contain whether consent for the abortion was provided and by whom; and, if consent was not provided, on which basis the abortion was performed.  Under current law, DHS is required to collect the reported information in a manner that ensures anonymity of the patient who obtained the abortion, the health care provider who performed the abortion, and the facility in which the abortion was performed.  Under current law, DHS is required to publish annual demographic summaries of the reported information except what reveals the identity of a patient, provider, or facility.\n\nThe bill requires the hospital, clinic, or other facility to report the probable postfertilization age of the unborn child and whether ultrasound was used to assist in that determination of postfertilization age; or, if the probable postfertilization age of the unborn child was not determined, the nature of the medical emergency.  If the unborn child is considered capable of experiencing pain, the bill requires reporting of the nature of the pregnant woman's medical emergency and a statement of whether the method of abortion used was one that provided the best opportunity for the unborn child's survival.\n\nUnder current law, a woman upon whom an abortion is to be performed or induced must give voluntary and informed written consent to an abortion.  Except in a medical emergency, a woman's consent to an abortion is considered informed only if, at least 24 hours before the abortion is performed or induced, the physician or an assistant has, in person, orally provided the woman with certain information and given to the woman certain written materials.  If the pregnancy is the result of sexual assault or incest, the 24-hour period, but not the provision of information, may be waived or reduced under certain circumstances.  In addition to the current requirement to inform the woman, orally and in writing, of the probable gestational age, the bill requires that the woman be informed, orally and in writing, of the probable postfertilization age of the unborn child and the numerical odds of survival for an unborn child delivered at that probable postfertilization age.  The bill also requires that the woman be orally informed of and provided written materials on the availability of perinatal hospice.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB179-engrossed,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  69.186 (1) (hf) of the statutes is created to read:\nSB179-engrossed,3,62\n69.186 (1) (hf)  The probable postfertilization age of the unborn child, as defined 3in s. 253.107 (1) (c), and whether an ultrasound was used to assist in making the 4determination of postfertilization age of the unborn child, or, if the probable 5postfertilization age of the unborn child was not determined, the nature of the 6medical emergency, as defined in s. 253.10 (2) (d).\nSB179-engrossed,2\n\n\n7Section \n2.  69.186 (1) (k) and (L) of the statutes are created to read:\nSB179-engrossed,3,108\n69.186 (1) (k)  If the unborn child is considered to be capable of experiencing 9pain under s. 253.107 (3) (a), the nature of the medical emergency, as defined in s. 10253.10 (2) (d), that the pregnant woman had.\nSB179-engrossed,3,1711\n(L)  If the unborn child is considered to be capable of experiencing pain under 12s. 253.107 (3) (a), a statement whether the method of abortion used was one that, in 13reasonable medical judgment, provided the best opportunity for the unborn child to 14survive or, if such a method was not used, the basis of the determination that 15termination of the pregnancy in that manner posed a greater risk either of the death 16of the pregnant woman or of the substantial and irreversible physical impairment 17of a major bodily function of the woman than other available methods.\nSB179-engrossed,3\n\n\n1Section \n3.  253.10 (2) (dr) of the statutes is created to read:\nSB179-engrossed,4,72\n253.10 (2) (dr)  \"Perinatal hospice\" means comprehensive support that includes 3support from the time of a terminal diagnosis of an unborn child through the birth 4and death of the child and through the postpartum period and may include the 5supportive care of maternal-fetal medical specialists, obstetricians, neonatologists, 6anesthesia specialists, specialty nurses, psychiatrists, psychologists, mental health 7professionals, clergy, social workers, and other professionals.\nSB179-engrossed,4\n\n\n8Section \n4.  253.10 (3) (c) 1. b. of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB179-engrossed,4,149\n253.10 (3) (c) 1. b.

If the court determines that a woman's identity should be 11kept confidential, the court shall issue orders to the parties, witnesses, and counsel 12and shall direct the sealing of the record and exclusion of individuals from 13courtrooms or hearing rooms to the extent necessary to safeguard the woman's 14identity from public disclosure.  If the court issues an order to keep a woman's 15identity confidential, the court shall provide written findings explaining why the 16woman's identity should be kept confidential, why the order is essential to that end, 17how the order is narrowly tailored to its purpose, and why no reasonable less 18restrictive alternative exists.\nSB179-engrossed,8,2219\n(b)  Any person, except for a public official, who brings an action under this 20section shall do so under a pseudonym unless the person obtains the written consent 21of the woman upon whom an abortion was performed or induced, or attempted to be 22performed or induced, in violation of this section.\nSB179-engrossed,8,2423\n(c)  This section may not be construed to allow the identity of a plaintiff or a 24witness to be concealed from the defendant.\n            Down\r\n        Down\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Up\r\n        Up\r\nSB179-engrossed,9,3\n1(7)  Construction.

The legislature finds that the best current evidence 6confirms:\nSB179-engrossed,9,97\n(a)  Pain receptors (unborn child's entire body nociceptors) are present no later 8than 16 weeks after fertilization and nerves link these receptors to the brain's 9thalamus and subcortical plate by no later than 20 weeks.\nSB179-engrossed,9,1110\n(b)  By 8 weeks after fertilization, the unborn child reacts to stimuli that would 11be recognized as painful if applied to an adult human, for example, by recoiling.\nSB179-engrossed,9,1312\n(c)  In the unborn child, application of painful stimuli is associated with 13significant increases in stress hormones known as the stress response.\nSB179-engrossed,9,1614\n(d)  Subjection to painful stimuli is associated with long-term harmful 15neuro-developmental effects, such as altered pain sensitivity and, possibly, 16emotional, behavioral, and learning disabilities later in life.\nSB179-engrossed,9,1917\n(e)  For the purposes of surgery on unborn children, fetal anesthesia is routinely 18administered and is associated with a decrease in stress hormones compared to their 19level when painful stimuli is applied without the anesthesia.\nSB179-engrossed,9,2420\n(f)  The position, asserted by some medical experts, that the unborn child is 21incapable of experiencing pain until a point later in pregnancy than 20 weeks after 22fertilization predominately rests on the assumption that the ability to experience 23pain depends on the cerebral cortex and requires nerve connections between the 24thalamus and the cortex.  However, recent medical research and analysis, especially 1since 2007, provides strong evidence for the conclusion that a functioning cortex is 2not necessary to experience pain.\nSB179-engrossed,10,43\n(g)  Substantial evidence indicates that children born missing the bulk of the 4cerebral cortex, those with hydraencephaly, nevertheless experience pain.\nSB179-engrossed,10,65\n(h)  In adults, stimulation or ablation of the cerebral cortex does not alter pain 6perception while stimulation or ablation of the thalamus does.\nSB179-engrossed,10,107\n(i)  Substantial evidence indicates that structures used for pain processing in 8early development differ from those of adults, using different neural elements 9available at specific times during development, such as the subcortical plate, to fulfill 10the role of pain processing.\nSB179-engrossed,10,2211\n(j)  Consequently, there is substantial medical evidence that an unborn child is 12capable of experiencing pain by 20 weeks after fertilization.  The legislature has the 13constitutional authority to make this judgment.  As the U.S. supreme court has noted 14in Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124, 164-64 (2007): \"The Court has given state and 15federal legislatures wide discretion to pass legislation in areas where there is 16medical and scientific uncertainty...See Marshall v. United States, 414 U.S. 417, 427 17(1974) (`When Congress undertakes to act in areas fraught with medical and 18scientific uncertainties, legislative options must be especially broad.') The law need 19not give abortion doctors unfettered choice in the course of their medical practice, nor 20should it elevate their status above other physicians in the medical community. 21...Medical uncertainty does not foreclose the exercise of legislative power in the 22abortion context any more than it does in other contexts.\"\nSB179-engrossed,11,723\n(k)  It is the purpose of the state to assert a compelling state interest in 24protecting the lives of unborn children from the stage at which substantial medical 25evidence indicates that they are capable of feeling pain.  In enacting this legislation, 1Wisconsin is not asking the Supreme Court to overturn or replace its holding, first 2articulated in Roe v. Wade and reaffirmed in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern 3Pennsylvania v. Casey, that the state interest in unborn human life, which is 4\"legitimate\" throughout pregnancy, becomes \"compelling\" at viability.  Rather, it 5asserts a separate and independent compelling state interest in unborn human life 6that exists once the unborn child is capable of feeling pain.  It is asserted not in 7replacement of, but in addition, to, the state interest in the viable unborn child.\nSB179-engrossed,11,148\n(l)  The U.S. supreme court has established that the \"constitutional liberty of 9the woman to have some freedom to terminate her pregnancy...is not so 10unlimited...that from the outset the State cannot show its concern for the life of the 11unborn, and at a later point in fetal development the State's interest in life has 12sufficient force so that the right of the woman to terminate the pregnancy can be 13restricted.\"  Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, 505 U.S. 14833, 869 (1992).\nSB179-engrossed,12,515\n(m)  The Supreme Court decision upholding the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban 16Act, Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124 (2007) vindicated the dissenting opinion in 17the earlier decision that had struck down Nebraska's Partial-Birth Abortion Ban 18Act.  That opinion stated, \"[In Casey] We held it was inappropriate for the Judicial 19Branch to provide an exhaustive list of state interests implicated by 20abortion....Casey is premised on the States having an important constitutional role 21in defining their interests in the abortion debate.  It is only with this principle in 22mind that [a state's] interests can be given proper weight. ... States also have an 23interest in forbidding medical procedures which, in the State's reasonable 24determination, might cause the medical profession or society as a whole to become 25insensitive, even disdainful, to life, including life in the human fetus.... A State may 1take measures to ensure the medical profession and its members are viewed as 2healers, sustained by a compassionate and rigorous ethic and cognizant of the 3dignity and value of human life, even life which cannot survive without the 4assistance of others.\"  Stenberg v. Carhart, 530 U.S. 914, 958-59 (2000) (Kennedy, 5J., dissenting.).\nSB179-engrossed,9\n\n\n6Section \n9.\nEffective date.\nSB179-engrossed,12,87\n(1)  This act takes effect on the first day of the 7th month beginning after 8publication.\nSB179-engrossed,12,99\n(End)\n            Down\r\n        Down\r\n\r\n    \r\n"

If a state employee does not use all of his or her sick leave during a calendar year, he or she may accumulate unused sick leave from year to year in a sick leave account.  Generally, if a state employee terminates employment and meets certain conditions related to age or years of employment, the employee's accumulated unused sick leave may be converted, at his or her highest basic pay rate, to credits for the payment of postretirement health insurance premiums under a health insurance plan administered by the Group Insurance Board.\n\nThis bill provides that no state senator or representative to the assembly may accrue any new sick leave as a state senator or representative to the assembly during any term of office that begins after the bill's effective date.  The bill does not affect any sick leave accrued by a state senator or representative to the assembly during a term of office that began before the bill's effective date.\n\nFor further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB183,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  13.121 (4) of the statutes is renumbered 13.121 (4) (a) and amended 2to read:\nSB183,2,113\n13.121 (4) (a)  For the purpose of premium determinations under s. 40.05 (4) 4and (5) each member of the legislature shall accrue sick leave at a rate equivalent 5to a percentage of time worked recommended for such positions by the director of the 6office of state employment relations and approved by the joint committee on 7employment relations in the same manner as compensation for such positions is 8determined under s. 20.923, except as provided in par. (b).  This percentage of time 9worked shall be applied to the sick leave accrual rate established under s. 230.35 (2).  10The approved percentage shall be incorporated into the compensation plan under s. 11230.12 (1).\nSB183,2\n\n\n12Section \n2.  13.121 (4) (b) of the statutes is created to read:\nSB183,2,1713\n13.121 (4) (b)  No member of the legislature may accrue any new sick leave as 14a member of the legislature during any term of office that begins after the effective 15date of this paragraph ....

Taylor, cosponsored by Representatives Nerison, Berceau, Bowen and Sinicki. Referred to Committee on Health and Human Services.\n\nSB185,1,8\n1An Act to renumber 448.970; to amend 15.085 (1m) (b), 146.997 (1) (d) 4., 2155.01 (7), 448.03 (2) (a) and 450.10 (3) (a) 5.; and to create 15.406 (7), 146.81 3(1) (eu), 252.14 (1) (ar) 4s., 440.03 (13) (b) 19c., 440.08 (2) (a) 24am. and 4subchapter VIII of chapter 448 [precedes 448.971] of the statutes; relating to: 5creation of a clinical exercise physiology affiliated credentialing board, 6licensure of clinical exercise physiologists, extending the time limit for 7emergency rule procedures, providing an exemption from emergency rule 8procedures, granting rule-making authority, and providing a penalty.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nThis bill regulates the practice of clinical exercise physiology, defined in the bill to include working with individuals who have chronic medical conditions for which exercise training has been shown to have a therapeutic benefit; administering clinical exercise assessments to individuals who have or are at risk for cardiovascular, pulmonary, or other chronic medical conditions; providing individuals with education and instruction based upon medical history, clinical assessment outcomes, and exercise training principles; and developing and implementing exercise training protocols and programs for individuals who have or are at risk for cardiovascular, pulmonary, and other chronic medical conditions for which exercise training has been shown to have a therapeutic benefit.  Under the bill, no one may use the title \"clinical exercise physiologist\" or make similar representations without a license to practice clinical exercise physiology (license).  A license is granted by the five-member Clinical Exercise Physiology Affiliated Credentialing Board (board), created in the bill.  Under the bill, the board is attached for limited purposes to the Medical Examining Board, which regulates physicians and certain other professions.\n\nUnder the bill, the board may grant an initial license to a person who is at least 18 years of age, holds a master's degree in exercise physiology or a related field, is certified by the American College of Sports Medicine, has at least 600 hours of qualifying clinical experience, and pays a fee.  The bill also allows the board, for one year after the requirement in the bill to obtain a license goes into effect, to grant an initial license to practice clinical exercise physiology to certain individuals who cannot satisfy all of the requirements described above but who satisfy certain experience and other requirements.\n\nThe bill requires the board to promulgate rules that establish the qualifying degrees and qualifying clinical experience that are required for licensure, a scope of practice for clinical exercise physiologists, and standards for what constitutes unprofessional conduct for a clinical exercise physiologist.\n\nThe bill includes provisions for the professional discipline of licensees, which allow the board to take certain actions against a licensee who violates certain prohibitions in the bill.\n\nFinally, the bill also applies certain other laws, such as the law providing for confidentiality of health care records and the health care workers whistleblowers protection law, to licensed clinical exercise physiologists.\n\nBecause this bill creates a new crime or revises a penalty for an existing crime, the Joint Review Committee on Criminal Penalties may be requested to prepare a report concerning the proposed penalty and the costs or savings that are likely to result if the bill is enacted.\n\nFor further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB185,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  15.085 (1m) (b) of the statutes is amended to read:\nSB185,2,52\n15.085 (1m) (b)  The public members of the podiatry affiliated credentialing 3board or, occupational therapists affiliated credentialing board, or clinical exercise 4physiology affiliated credentialing board shall not be engaged in any profession or 5occupation concerned with the delivery of physical or mental health care.\nSB185,2\n\n\n1Section \n2\n.  15.406 (7) of the statutes is created to read:\nSB185,3,62\n15.406 (7)  Clinical exercise physiology affiliated credentialing board.  3There is created in the department of safety and professional services, attached to 4the medical examining board, a clinical exercise physiology affiliated credentialing 5board.

Brooks and Bowen. Referred to Committee on Elections and Local Government.\n\nSB192,1,9\n1An Act to repeal 66.0137 (4m) (a); to renumber and amend 66.0137 (1) (ae); 2to amend 20.835 (1) (db), 59.23 (2) (s), 66.0137 (3), 66.0137 (5) (c) 1., 66.0137 3(5) (c) 2., 79.01 (2d) and 79.035 (5); to repeal and recreate 66.0137 (5) (c) 3.; 4and to create 16.14, 20.505 (1) (cr), 66.0137 (1) (af), 66.0137 (1) (ag), 66.0137 5(1) (am), 66.0137 (1) (ap), 66.0137 (1) (c), 66.0137 (5) (c) 1m., 66.0137 (5) (c) 4. 6and 79.035 (6) of the statutes; relating to: requiring the payment of health 7insurance premiums, and establishing a loan program, for survivors of a law 8enforcement officer, emergency medical technician, or fire fighter who dies, or 9has died, in the line of duty and making appropriations.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nThe bill requires a municipality or county (political subdivision) that pays health insurance premiums for its employees who are law enforcement officers or emergency medical technicians (EMTs) to pay such premiums for the surviving spouse and certain children of a law enforcement officer or EMT who dies, or has died, in the line of duty.\n\nSubject to a number of limitations, current law requires a city, village, or town (municipality) that pays health insurance premiums for its employees who are fire fighters to pay such premiums for the surviving spouse and dependent children of a fire fighter who dies, or has died, in the line of duty.  This general current law requirement does not apply to a surviving spouse who remarries or reaches the age of 65, or to a dependent child who reaches the age of 18 and is not a full-time high school student.  Current law does require premium payments to be made for a dependent child who is a full-time or part-time student in an accredited college or university until the close of the calendar year in which the individual reaches the age of 26.  This bill does not require such premium payments to be made after such an individual reaches the age of 26.\n\nIn addition to the new requirements to pay such premiums for law enforcement officers and EMT personnel, and surviving spouses and certain children who have not reached the age of 26, the bill requires the state to reimburse political subdivisions for premiums paid to cover the surviving spouses and children, until they reach the age of 26 or have insurance through their employer, of fallen fire fighters, law enforcement officers, and EMTs that were paid by the political subdivisions and that were not otherwise required to be paid under an employment-related benefit provided to the fire fighter, law enforcement officer, or EMT.  The bill establishes a process whereby political subdivisions may seek reimbursement of the payment of premiums from the Department of Administration (DOA).  The state is to pay these health insurance premiums only after any sick leave credits that may be used for the purchase of health insurance have been exhausted.\n\nThe bill further requires DOA to establish a loan program for surviving spouses of law enforcement officers and fire fighters who have died in the line of duty.  The loan program must provide for the payment of a loan to a surviving spouse in an amount equal to the salary that would have been paid his or her deceased spouse had he or she not died in the line of duty.  The loan must be disbursed to coincide with the pay period that applied to the deceased spouse, must be secured by the proceeds of any life insurance policy that covered the deceased spouse, and must come due when a surviving spouse receives the proceeds from the life insurance policy that covered his or her deceased spouse.  No loan may be made for any period after the proceeds of a life insurance policy have been disbursed to the surviving spouse.  To qualify for a loan, a surviving spouse must apply for the loan on a form prepared by DOA; provide all documentation required by DOA to verify that his or her spouse died in the line of duty; provide all documentation required by DOA to verify the salary of the deceased spouse; and enter into an agreement with DOA that any loan must be secured by the proceeds of a life insurance policy that covered his or her deceased spouse.\n\nUnder the bill, the amounts that DOA disburses for premiums, reimbursements, and loans for surviving spouses of law enforcement officers, EMTs, and fire fighters employed by a political subdivision are paid from the county and municipal aid account (shared revenue), and the total amount of shared revenue payments is decreased by the amounts disbursed by DOA.\n\nThe bill first applies, retroactively, to a law enforcement officer, EMT, or fire fighter who has died in the line of duty before the effective date of the bill, but only with respect to the payment of health insurance premiums that come due on or after the effective date of this bill.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nSB192,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  16.14 of the statutes is created to read:\nSB192,3,4\n216.14  Paying health insurance premiums, and establishing a loan 3program, for dependents of law enforcement officers or fire fighters who 4die in line of duty.
