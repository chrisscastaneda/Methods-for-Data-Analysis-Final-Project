      "billId": "Juvenile Offender Performance Incentive Funding Act Exposed",
      "billText": "\nSummary\nThe provisions of this act are intended to incentivize the reduction of juvenile re-offending, reduce costs to taxpayers, and increase victim restitution, by giving probation departments a share of the savings to the state in reduced incarceration costs when they lower recidivism and commitments of youths to the state.\n\nModel Legislation\nSection 1. {Intent}\n(A)The provisions of this act are intended to reduce recidivism rates in juvenile offenders, while decreasing juvenile correctional costs, by giving local probation departments a share of the savings to the state when they reduce the number of juveniles committed to state custody for incarceration. By linking funding to performance, this legislation creates a positive incentive for local juvenile probation departments to improve their treatment practices for juveniles to both enhance public safety and reduce costs to taxpayers.\nSection 2. {Definitions}\n(A) “Evidence-based practices” means supervision policies, procedures, programs and practices that scientific research demonstrates reduce recidivism among juveniles on probation, parole, or post-release supervision.\n(B) “Supervised juvenile” means a juvenile placed on probation by a court or serving a period of parole or post-release supervision from incarceration.\n(C) “Conditions of supervision” means conditions of probation, parole or other form of post- prison supervision.\nSection 3. {Calculation of State Juvenile Incarceration Savings}\n(A)The [state oversight agency] shall annually calculate:\n\n(1) For each local juvenile probation department, the percentage change in the number of juveniles committed to state custody for incarceration as a ratio of overall referrals to the juvenile probation department for that year. This calculation shall be compared to the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year in which the report is required pursuant to Section 6 of this title.\n(2) Any state expenditures that have been avoided by reductions in rates of juveniles committed to state custody for incarceration by each county, as calculated in paragraph (1) of this section.\nSection 4. {Performance Incentive Funding}\n(A)Beginning in fiscal year 201[x], the legislature shall annually appropriate up to 45 percent of any state expenditures that are avoided as calculated in Section 3 of this title. Such averted expenditures shall be appropriated to the [state or local agency or agencies] responsible for those savings.\n(B) The appropriations in paragraph (A) of this section are subject to the following provisions:\n\n(1) None of the calculated savings shall be appropriated annually to the [state or local agency or agencies] if there is an increase in the percentage of juveniles committed to state incarceration by [that agency or agencies] as calculated in Section 3 paragraph (A)(1) of this title.\n(2) Of the state expenditures that have been avoided by a reduction in the proportion of juveniles committed state custody for incarceration as calculated in Section 3 paragraph (A)(1) of this section:\n(a) Thirty percent of the total savings shall be appropriated to the state or local agency or agencies;\n(b) An additional five percent of the total savings shall be appropriated to the [state or local agency or agencies] if there is an increase in the percentage of juveniles who are supervised by [that agency or agencies] and who are employed in a full-time job, employed part time for at least 25 hours per week, or attending school full-time, provided that the agency has submitted data to the [state oversight agency] showing such increases, and the [state oversight agency] includes this information in the report required pursuant to Section 6 of this title;\n(c) An additional five per cent of the total savings shall be appropriated to the [state or local agency or agencies] if there is an increase in the percentage of juveniles who are supervised by that [agency or agencies] who are current in their payments of victim restitution, provided that the [agency] has submitted data to the [state oversight agency] showing such increases and the [state oversight agency] includes this information in the report required pursuant to Section 6 of this title;\n(d) An additional five percent of the total savings shall be appropriated to the [state or local agency or agencies] if there is a decrease in the percentage of juveniles who are supervised by [that agency or agencies] and who test positive for controlled substances. \n(3) The monies appropriated pursuant to this title shall be used to supplement, not supplant, any other state or county appropriations for probation, parole or other post-prison supervision services.\nSection 5. {Use of Funds}\n(A) Monies received through appropriations pursuant to this title shall be used for the following purposes:\n\n(1) Implementation of evidence-based practices;\n(2) Increasing the availability of risk reduction programs and interventions, including problem-solving courts, substance abuse treatment programs, family-based treatment programs, and mental health treatment programs, for supervised juveniles;\n(3) Grants to nonprofit victim services organizations to partner with the community corrections agencies and courts to assist victims and increase the amount of restitution collected from juvenile probationers. \nSection 6. {Reports}\n(A) On or before [October 1] of each year, beginning in 201[x], the judicial branch, [units of local government] and the state [Department of Juvenile Justice] shall jointly report to the [state oversight agency] the data necessary for the [state oversight agency] to perform the calculations required by Section 3 of this title. The report shall provide separate figures for probation and parole or other form of post-prison supervision and include for the prior fiscal year:\n\n(1) The number of supervised juveniles, by agency; and\n(2) The number and percentage of supervised juveniles, by agency, who were committed to state custody for incarceration by the [Department of Juvenile Justice].\n(B) On or before [December 1] of each year, beginning in 201[x], the [state oversight agency] shall report each year on the implementation of this title to the president of the senate, the speaker of the house of representatives, the chief justice of the supreme court, and the governor.

      "billId": "The Provisional Licenses for Ex-Offenders Act Exposed",
      "billText": "\nSummary\nThis bill allows certain ex-offenders to obtain a provisional, or probationary, occupational license if they are otherwise qualified. Research indicates that a person who has been law abiding for at least five years is at a low risk of re-offending. Also, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, ex-offenders who are employed are three to five times less likely to re-offend.\n\nModel Legislation\nSection 1. {Provisional License}\n(A) Notwithstanding any other law and unless the applicant has been convicted of an offense described by Section 2, a licensing authority shall issue to an otherwise qualified applicant who has been convicted of a nonviolent offense not less than two years ago or a violent offense not less than four years ago: an offense:\n\n(1) The license for which the applicant applied; or\n(2) A provisional license.\n(B) The provisional license shall be valid for a term of between 90 and 360 days, as specified by agency rule.\n(C) The licensing authority may revoke a provisional license if the provisional license holder:\n\n(1) Commits a new offense;\n(2) Commits an act or omission that causes the person's community supervision, mandatory supervision, or parole to be revoked, if applicable; or\n(3) Violates the law or rules governing the practice of the occupation for which the provisional license is issued.\n(D) The licensing authority shall issue the license for which the applicant originally applied to a provisional license holder on the expiration of the provisional license term if the provisional license holder does not engage in conduct described by Subsection (C) of this Section.\n(E) If the licensing authority revokes a provisional license under Subsection (C) of this Section, the provisional license holder is not entitled to receive another provisional license or a regular license for which the applicant originally applied, even if otherwise qualified. The ability of such a person to subsequently obtain another such license in the future is within the discretion of the issuing agency.\n(F) An applicant who is on community supervision and who is issued a provisional license under this section shall provide to the licensing authority the name and contact information of the probation or parole department to which the person reports. The licensing authority shall notify the probation or parole department that a provisional license has been issued. The probation or parole department shall notify the licensing authority if the person's community supervision is revoked during the term of the provisional license. The court shall also notify the agency if the person is charged with a new offense.\n(H) If the person was convicted of an offense that involved robbery, residential burglary, or a home invasion of any kind within the last ten years and if the occupation is one in which a licensee regularly enters private residences, the provisional license must include a condition that the person only work under the accompanying supervision of another licensed individual who has no criminal record in all home visits and the supervising individual must sign a verifying affidavit. If the offense occurred more than ten years ago, the condition is discretionary with the agency. The regular license may include this condition as long as the agency determines it is warranted. The agency may conduct reasonable enforcement activities to ensure this supervision condition is complied with over the course of the license term.\n(I) Nothing herein shall be implicitly interpreted to preclude an agency from exercising its existing discretion to issue a license to individuals not covered under this statute, except where precluded by another law.\n(J) The licensing agency may set a time limitation of not more than two years having passed since applicant’s last conviction(s), provided that if the person is incarcerated they may be denied a provisional license even if the waiting period has elapsed.\nSection 2. {Exemptions}\n(A) This Act does not apply to a person convicted of homicide, an aggravated violent felony offense, a felony sex offense, or kidnapping.\n(B) This Act does not apply to a person convicted of an offense involving fraud if the licensed occupation is one in which the licensee owes a fiduciary duty to a client.\n(C) This Act does not apply to any occupation where the licensee would be supervising children or individuals who lack mental capacity without another licensee in the same room at all times.\n(D) This Act does not apply to any initial or renewal license application where the applicant was convicted of committing an offense in the course of performing the duties of the occupation or a substantially similar occupation.\n(E) If the licensing agency believes another exemption not provided herein is necessary in a specific case to protect the public from a clear and imminent danger, the agency may seek declaratory relief in district court through a judicial order finding that the applicant should not be issued a regular or provisional license because it would pose such a danger.\nSection 3. {Severability clause}\nSection 4. {Repealer clause}\nSection 5. {Effective date}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

      "billText": "\nSummary\nThis Act requires a bail agent to pay all forfeiture judgments in a timely manner. No further bonds may be accepted from that agent anywhere in the state until the judgment is satisfied. This legislation intends to eliminate fly-by-night bonding practices.\n\nModel Legislation\nSection 1. {Definitions}\nSection 2. {Forfeiture upon Failure to Appear}\nUpon the defendant having failed to appear at a required court appearance, the court shall declare the bail bond to be forfeited. The clerk of the court shall mail a notice of the forfeiture to both the surety and bail agent within fifteen (15) days of the non-appearance and order of forfeiture. A certificate signed by the clerk of the court or the court’s designee, made under penalty of perjury, certifying that the notice required herein was mailed on a specific date and accompanied by a copy of the required notice, shall constitute sufficient proof that such mailing was properly accomplished as indicated herein. The failure of the court or its designee to mail the notice as indicated herein shall result in the setting aside of the forfeiture and exoneration of the bail bond or money deposited. In all other cases, the forfeiture shall be pain in full within sixty (60) days of the date appearing on the certificate of mailing on the forfeiture notice.\nSection 3. {Forfeiture to Judgment}\n(A). If the forfeiture is not paid or set aside by order of a court of competent jurisdiction within sixty (60) days from the date of the mailing of the notice of forfeiture, the clerk of the court for the county where the order of forfeiture was made shall enter a judgment against the surety for the penal amount of the bond. Within ten (10) days, the clerk shall furnish the Department of Insurance with a certified copy of the judgment and shall furnish the surety company at its home office a copy of the judgment, which shall reference the power of attorney number of the bond and the name of the executing agent. If the judgment is not paid within thirty (30) days, the clerk shall furnish the Department of Insurance and the sheriff of the county in which the bond was executed, or the official responsible for the operation of that county’s jail, if other than the sheriff, two (2) copies of the judgment and a certificate stating that the judgment remains unsatisfied.\n(B). Surety bail bonds may not be executed anywhere in the state by any agent of the judgment debtor surety if a judgment has been entered which then remains unpaid, and the Department of Insurance shall notice the surety to this effect. No sheriff or other official empowered to accept or approve bail bonds anywhere in the state shall accept of approve a bond from an agent or surety company that has failed to pay a judgment after thirty-five (35) days from the entry of the judgment, until such judgment ahs been paid in full.\n(C). When and if the judgment is satisfied or an order to vacate the judgment is entered by a court of competent jurisdiction, the clerk shall immediately notify the sheriff, or other official responsible for the operation of the county jail, if other than the sheriff, and the Department of Insurance of such payment or order vacating the judgment. The Department of Insurance shall thereupon notice the surety of their reinstatement.\nSection 4. {Relief from Forfeitures Requirement}\n(A). If a motion to set the forfeiture or judgment is filed, as a condition of such filing and any subsequent order staying the enforcement of the judgment, the bail agent or surety shall pay the full amount of the judgment, in cash, to the clerk of the court. Such payment will be held in escrow by the court until such time as the court has ruled on the motion. The filing of such motion, when accompanied by the required escrow deposit, shall act as an automatic stay on further proceedings, including execution of the judgment and notice to the Department of Insurance and sheriff, until such motion has been heard and a decision rendered by the court.\n(B). If an appeal is taken from the court’s adverse ruling on a motion to set aside, that ruling may be appealed from, but there shall be no stay of collection proceedings absent the cash escrow remaining in place. Should a motion on appeal be ruled upon in favor of the surety, the escrowed funds shall be fully remitted within then (10) days after certified copy of the order is delivered to the clerk.\nSection 5. {Remission of Forfeiture}\n(A). In the event that a forfeiture is paid, on application by the bail agent or surety brought at any time within three (3) years from the date of payment, the court shall order remission of the payment according to the below-described terms:\n\n1. That the bond is, for any cause, not a valid and binding undertaking in law. If it be valid and binding as to the principal, and one or more of his sureties, if any, they shall not be exonerated from liability because of its being invalid and not binding as to another surety or sureties, if any. If it be invalid and not binding as to the principal, each of the sureties, if any, shall be exonerated by liability. If it be valid and binding as to the principal, but not so as to the sureties, if any, the principal shall not be exonerated, but the sureties, if any, shall be.\n2. The death of the principal before the forfeiture was taken.\n3. The sickness of the principal or some uncontrollable circumstance which prevented his appearance at court, and it must, in every such case, be shown that his failure to appear arose from no fault on his part.\n4. Failure to present an indictment or information at the first term of the court which may be held after the principal has been admitted to bail, in a case where the party was bound over before indictment or information, and the prosecution has not been continued by order of the court.\n5. The incarceration of the principal in any jurisdiction in the United States. A surety exonerated under (5) remains obligated to pay costs of court, and any reasonable and necessary costs incurred by a county to secure the return of the principal.\n(B). For other good cause shown, the court in its discretion may remit to the surety all or part of the amount of the bond after deducting the costs of court and any reasonable necessary costs to the county for the return of the principal.\nSection 6. {Severability}\nSection 7. {Effective Date}\n\nAdopted by the Criminal Justice Task Force at the States and Nation Policy Summit, December 4, 2004. \nApproved by the ALEC Board of Directors January 7, 2005.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

      "billText": "\nSummary\nThis Act grants a bail agent a remission period to recover a fugitive that has skipped bail, even after the time deadline for a bail agent to recover that person has passed and the bail agent has paid the forfeiture judgment. If the bondsman recovers the fugitive during the remission period, the bondsman can recover all or part of the forfeiture judgment paid. This bill is designed to enhance public safety by giving the bail agent a financial incentive to locate and recover the fugitive, in addition to serving both the interests of the courts and of public safety.\n\nModel Legislation\nSection 1. {Definitions}\nSection 2. {Forfeiture of Bail}\n1. A court shall in open court declare forfeited the bail bond if, without sufficient excuse, a defendant fails to appear for any of the following:\n\na. Arraignment;\nb. Trial;\nc. Judgment; or\nd. Any other occasion prior to the pronouncement of judgment in which the defendant’s presence in court is lawfully required.\n2. The clerk of the court shall, within thirty (30) days of the entry of the forfeiture, mail notice of the forfeiture to the surety and to the bail agent whose names are printed on the bond. The bond shall plainly display the mailing address of both the statutory home office of the corporate surety and the bail agent. The forfeiture shall be mailed to the surety at the statutory home office and to the bail agent and mailing alone to the surety or the bail agent shall not constitute compliance with this Section.\n3. The surety or depositor shall be released of all obligations under the bond if any of the following conditions apply:\n\na. The clerk fails to mail notice of forfeiture in accordance with this Section within thirty (30) days after the entry of the forfeiture; or\nb. The clerk fails to mail the notice of forfeiture to the surety at the address printed on the bond; or\nc. The clerk fails to mail a copy of the notice of forfeiture to the bail agent at the address printed on the bond.\nSection 3. {Relief from Forfeiture}\nIf the defendant appears either voluntarily or in custody after surrender or arrest in court within one hundred eighty (180) days of the date of the mailing of the notice of forfeiture, the court shall on its own motion at the time that the defendant first appears in court on the case in which the forfeiture was entered, direct the order for forfeiture be vacated and the bond exonerated. If the court fails to so act on its own motion, then the surety’s obligations under the bond shall be immediately vacated and the bond exonerated.\nSection 4. {Payment of Summary Judgment and Remission}\nIf, prior to the expiration of the one hundred eighty (180) day period, the surety or bail agent deposits funds in the full amount of the bail bond into an escrow account maintained by the court, then the original one hundred eighty (180) day period shall be extended by an additional one hundred eighty (180) days. Timely payment of these funds is a condition precedent to the one hundred eighty (180) day extension and shall not be waived by any court. The court may impose a fee of up to fifty dollars ($50.00) for the cost of maintaining the escrow account. If within the extension period the order forfeiting bail is vacated and the bail bond exonerated for any reason, the Superior Court shall within thirty (30) days of the entry of such order return to the party that deposited the funds the formerly deposited funds plus interest, if any. After entry of summary judgment pursuant to Section 4., or after a final decision upholding the summary judgment on appeal, the Superior Court shall utilize funds deposited into the escrow account to satisfy the summary judgment. If the summary judgment is reversed, the bond amount shall be returned to the party that deposited the funds within thirty (30) days of the filing of the remitter reversing the summary judgment.\nSection 5. {Non-Payment; Report to Department of Insurance}\nWithin thirty (30) days of the expiration of the initial one hundred eighty (180) day period, assuming that the deposit described in Section 3 has not been made, summary judgment shall be entered against the surety on the bond within thirty (30) days. In the event that the deposit is made, the summary judgment shall be entered within thirty (30) days. If the surety fails to satisfy the summary judgment within thirty (30) days of entry shall result in a suspension of that surety’s right to post bail in the state. Additionally, the court shall notify the state Division of Insurance of the surety’s non-payment.\nSection 6. {Severability}\nSection 7. {Effective Date}\n\nAdopted by the Criminal Justice Task Force at the States and Nation Policy Summit, December 4, 2004. \nApproved by the ALEC Board of Directors January 7, 2005.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

      "billId": "Crimes with Bail Restrictions Act Exposed",
      "billText": "\nSummary: \nThe purpose of this act is to enhance public safety. The Bureau of Justice Statistics has shown that defendants released on unsecured bonds were the most likely not to show and thus end up as fugitives. Around 60% of those arrested on a felony charge are released pending trial either by means of commercial bail or by other less effective methods. In turn, about one third of these released defendants will be rearrested for a new offense. The data also shows that re-arrest rates are highest for those released on their own recognizance (ROR). Because of this and in order to enhance public safety, courts should increase the use of surety release and backtrack on the number of ROR’s, especially for more serious crimes. The act would prevent those more inclined to commit crimes from being released except on a surety bond.

      "billText": "\nSummary\nFor states to deliver swift, certain and proportionate responses to violations of probation and parole, they need an array of institutional and community-based sanctions as well as the authority to assign-and reassign-offenders to those sanctions. This Act requires community corrections agencies to adopt a set of graduated sanctions and rewards to respond to violations and compliance with the conditions of supervision. This Act also establishes authority for agencies to impose graduated sanctions and rewards through an administrative process.\n\nLegislation\nSection 1. {Definitions.}\nIn this title:\n(A) \"Agency\" means:\n\n(1) The Department of Corrections or the state agency responsible for supervising individuals placed on probation by the courts or serving a period of parole or post-release supervision from prison or jail; and\n(2) Any regional, local or county governmental agencies responsible for supervising individuals placed on probation by a court or serving a period of parole or post-release supervision from prison or jail, provided such agencies receive state funding.\n(B) \"Chief supervision officer\" means the highest ranking field probation or parole administrator in each judicial circuit.\n(C) \"Court\" means a court of record having original criminal jurisdiction.\n(D) \"Community supervision\" means\n\n(1) The placement of a defendant under a continuum of programs and sanctions, with conditions imposed by a court for a specified period during which:\n(a) criminal proceedings are deferred without an adjudication of guilt;\n(b) a sentence of imprisonment or confinement, imprisonment and fine, or confinement and fine, is probated and the imposition of sentence is suspended in whole or in part; or\n(2) The placement of an individual under a continuum of programs and sanctions after release from prison or jail, with conditions imposed by the releasing authority for a specified period.\n(E) \"Supervision officer\" means a person appointed or employed by the Agency to supervise individuals placed on community supervision.\n(F) \"Supervised individual\" means an individual placed on probation by a court or serving a period of parole or post-release supervision from prison or jail.\n(G) \"Graduated sanction\" means any of a wide range of non-prison offender accountability measures and programs, including, but not limited to, electronic supervision tools; drug and alcohol testing or monitoring; day or evening reporting centers; restitution centers; forfeiture of earned compliance credits; rehabilitative interventions such as substance abuse or mental health treatment; reporting requirements to supervision officers; community service or work crews; secure or unsecure residential treatment facilities or halfway houses; and short-term or intermittent incarceration.\n(H) \"Positive reinforcement\" means any of a wide range of rewards and incentives, including but not limited to awarding certificates of achievement, reducing reporting requirements, deferring a monthly supervision fee payment, awarding earned compliance credits, removing supervision conditions such as home detention or curfew, or asking the offender to be a mentor to others.\nSection 2. {Policy on Community Supervision.}\nIt is the policy of this state that supervised individuals shall be subject to:\n(A) Violation revocation proceedings and possible incarceration for failure to comply with the conditions of supervision when such failure constitutes a significant risk to prior victims of the supervised individual or the community at large, and cannot be appropriately managed in the community; or\n(B) Sanctions other than revocation and incarceration as appropriate to the severity of the violation behavior, the risk of future criminal behavior by the offender, and the need for, and availability of, interventions which may assist the offender to remain compliant and crime-free in the community.\nSection 3. {System of Graduated Sanctions.}\n(A) The Agency shall, by [January 1, 201X], adopt a single system of graduated sanctions for violations of conditions of community supervision. The system shall set forth a menu of presumptive sanctions for the most common types of supervision violations, including but not limited to: failure to report; failure to pay fines, fees, and victim restitution; failure to participate in a required program or service; failure to complete community service; violation of a protective or no contact order; and failure to refrain from the use of alcohol or controlled substances. The system of sanctions shall take into account factors such as the severity of the current violation, the supervised individual's previous criminal record, the number and severity of any previous supervision violations, the supervised individual's assessed risk level, and the extent to which graduated sanctions were imposed for previous violations. The system also shall define positive reinforcements that supervised individuals will receive for compliance with conditions of supervision.\n(B) The Agency shall establish by rules and regulations an administrative process to review and approve or reject, prior to imposition, graduated sanctions that deviate from those prescribed.\n(C) The Agency shall establish by rules and regulations an administrative process to review graduated sanctions contested by supervised individuals under Section 6 of this Act. The review shall be conducted by an impartial Agency employee or representative who has been selected, appointed and trained to hear cases regarding graduated sanctions for violations of supervision conditions.\nSection 4. {Conditions of Community Supervision.}\nFor individuals placed on probation, the judge of the court having jurisdiction of the case shall determine the conditions of community supervision and may impose as a condition of community supervision that the Agency supervising the individual may, in accordance with Section 6 of this Act, impose graduated sanctions adopted by the Agency for violations of the conditions of community supervision.\nSection 5. {Authority to Impose Graduated Sanctions.}\n(A) Notwithstanding any rule or law to the contrary, the Agency may:\n\n(1) Modify the conditions of community supervision for the limited purpose of imposing graduated sanctions; and\n(2) Place a supervised individual who violates the conditions of community supervision in a state or local correctional or detention facility or residential center for a period of not more than [five] days consecutively, and not more than [30] days in any one calendar year.\n(B) A supervision officer intending to modify the conditions of community supervision by imposing a graduated sanction shall issue to the supervised individual a notice of the intended sanction. The notice shall inform the supervised individual of the technical violation or violations alleged, the date or dates of the violation or violations, and the graduated sanction to be imposed.\n(C) The imposition of a graduated sanction or sanctions by a community supervision officer must comport with the system of graduated sanctions adopted by the Agency under Section 4 of this title. Upon receipt of the notice, the supervised individual shall immediately accept or object to the sanction or sanctions proposed by the officer. The failure of the supervised individual to comply with a sanction shall constitute a violation of probation, parole or post release supervision. If the supervised individual objects to the imposition of the sanction or sanctions, the individual is entitled to an administrative review to be conducted by the Agency within five days of the issuance of the notice. If the Agency affirms the recommendation contained in the notice, then the sanction or sanctions shall become effective immediately.\n(D) If the graduated sanction involves confinement in a correctional or detention facility, confinement must be approved by the chief supervision officer, but the supervised individual may be taken into custody for up to [four] hours while such approval is obtained. If the supervised individual is employed, the supervision officer shall, to the extent feasible, impose this sanction on weekend days or other days and times when the supervised individual is not working.\n(E) A sanction that confines a supervised individual in a correctional or detention facility for a period of more than [five] consecutive days, or extends the term of community supervision, may not be imposed as a graduated sanction, except pursuant to an order of the court or the releasing authority.\n(F) A notice of a graduated sanction may not be issued for any violation of probation, parole or post-release supervision which could warrant an additional, separate felony charge. Notwithstanding this, a notice of a graduated sanction may be issued for a positive drug test.\n(G) Upon successful completion of a graduated sanction or sanctions, a court may not revoke the term of community supervision or impose additional sanctions for the same violation.\n(H) If a supervision officer modifies the conditions of community supervision by imposing a graduated sanction, the officer shall:\n\n(1) Deliver a copy of the modified conditions to the supervised individual;\n(2) File a copy of the modified conditions with the sentencing court or releasing authority; and\n(3) Note the date of delivery of the copy in the supervised individual's file.\nSection 6. {Monitoring Graduated Sanctions.}\nThe chief supervision officer shall review confinement sanctions recommended by supervision officers on a quarterly basis to assess any disparities that may exist among officers, evaluate the effectiveness of the sanction as measured by the supervised individuals' subsequent conduct, and monitor the impact on the Agency's number and type of revocations for violations of the conditions of supervision.\nSection 7. {Severability Clause.}\nSection 8. {Repealer Clause}\nSection 9. {Effective Date}\n\nAdopted by the Public Safety and Elections Task Force at the Spring Task Force Meeting on April 28, 2010.\nApproved by the ALEC Board of Directors on June 3, 2010.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Defendants determined to be mentally ill\nwould be placed in the custody of the department of health until they are fit to stand\ntrial. Defendants determined to be dangerously mentally ill would be turned over to the\ndepartment of corrections until such time as they may be fit to stand trial.\nIf a defendant is still not fit to stand trial after a significant period of time, essentially a\nperiod of time exceeding the anticipated sentence for his crime, the court may decide to\ndismiss the charges. The defendant's mental state during the commission of a crime\nmay not be considered during prosecution but may be considered in deciding whether\nto incorporate treatment as part of the sentence.\n\nModel Legislation\n{Title, enacting clause, etc.}\nSection 1. {Title.}\nThis Act may be cited as the Insanity Defense Reform Act.\nSection 2. {Mental condition not a defense and provision for treatment\nduring incarceration.}\n(A) Mental condition shall not be a defense to any charge of criminal conduct.\n(B) If the court finds that a person convicted of a crime suffers from any mental\ncondition requiring treatment, such person shall be committed to the board of\ncorrections or such city or county official as provided by law for placement in an\nappropriate facility for treatment, having regard for such conditions of security as the\ncase may require. In the event a sentence of incarceration has been imposed, the\ndefendant shall receive treatment in a facility that provides for incarceration or less\nrestrictive confinement. In the event that a course of treatment thus commenced shall\nbe concluded prior to the expiration of the sentence imposed, the offender shall remain\nliable for the remainder of such sentence, but shall have credit for time incarcerated for\ntreatment.\n(C) Nothing herein is intended to prevent the admission of expert evidence concerning\nany state of mind which is an element of the offense, subject to the rules of evidence.\nSection 3. {Lack of capacity to understand proceedings.}\nNo person who, as a result of\nmental disease or defect, lacks capacity to understand the proceedings against him or\nher or to assist in his or her own defense shall be tried, convicted, sentenced, or\npunished for the commission of an offense so long as such incapacity endures.\nSection 4. {Examination of defendant.}\n(A) Whenever there is reason to doubt the defendant's fitness to proceed as set forth in\nSection 2 of this Act, the court shall appoint at least one qualified psychiatrist or licensed\npsychologist or shall request the director of the department of health and welfare to\ndesignate at least one qualified psychiatrist or licensed psychologist to examine the\nreport upon the mental condition of the defendant to assist counsel with defense or to\nunderstand the proceedings. The cost of examination shall be paid by the defendant if\nhe or she is financially able. The determination of ability to pay shall be made in\naccordance with the laws of this state governing provisions of counsel to indigent\ndefendants.\n(B) Within three days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, of the\nappointment or designation, the examiner shall determine the best location for the\nexamination. If practical, the examination shall be conducted locally on an outpatient\nbasis.\n(C) If the examiner determines that confinement is necessary for purposes of the\nexamination, the court may order the defendant to be confined to a jail, hospital, or\nother suitable facility for that purpose for a period not exceeding 30 days. The order of\nconfinement shall require the county sheriff to transport the defendant to and from the\nfacility and shall notify the facility of any known medical, behavioral, or security\nrequirements of the defendant. The court, upon request, may make available to the\nexaminer any court records relating to the defendant.\n(D) In such examination any method may be employed which is accepted by the\nexaminer's profession for the examination of those alleged not to be competent to assist\ncounsel in their defense.\n(E) Upon completion of the examination a report shall be submitted to the court and\nshall include the following:\n\n(1) a description of the nature of the examination;\n(2) a diagnosis or evaluation of the mental condition of the defendant;\n(3) an opinion as to the defendant's capacity to understand the proceedings against him or her and to assist in his or her own defense;\n(4) when directed by the court, an opinion as to the capacity of the defendant to form a particular state of mind which is an element of the offense charged.\n(F) If the examination cannot be conducted by reason of the unwillingness of the\ndefendant to participate therein, the report shall so state and shall include, if possible,\nan opinion as to whether such unwillingness of defendant was the result of mental\ndisease or defect.\n(G) The report of the examination shall be filed in triplicate with the clerk of the court,\nwho shall deliver copies to the prosecuting attorney and to counsel for the defendant.\n(H) When the defendant wishes to be examined by an expert of his own choice, such\nexaminer shall be permitted to have reasonable access to the defendant for the purpose\nof examination.\n(I) In addition to the psychiatrist or licensed psychologist, the court may appoint\nadditional experts to examine the defendant.\n(J) If the defendant lacks capacity to make informed decisions about treatment, the\ncourt may authorize consent to be given pursuant to the civil commitment laws of this\nstate. A defendant lacks capacity to make informed decisions about treatment if, by\nreason of mental illness, after conscientious efforts at explanation, he is unable to\nachieve a rudimentary understanding of the purpose, nature, and possible significant\nrisks and benefits of treatment.\n(K) If the defendant was confined solely for the purpose of examination, he shall be\nreleased from the facility within three days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal\nholidays, following notification of completion of the examination.\nSection 5. {Determination of fitness of defendant to proceed.}\n(A) When the defendant's fitness to proceed is drawn in question, the issue shall be\ndetermined by the court. If neither the prosecuting attorney nor counsel for the\ndefendant contests the findings of the report filed pursuant to Section 4 of this act, the\ncourt may make the determination on the basis of such report. If the finding is\ncontested, the court shall hold a hearing on the issue. If the report is received in\nevidence upon such hearing, the party who contests the finding thereof shall have the\nright to summon and to examine the psychiatrist or licensed psychologist who\nsubmitted the report and to offer evidence upon the issue.\n(B) If the court determines that the defendant lacks fitness to proceed, the proceeding\nagainst him shall be suspended, except as provided in Subsections (D) and (E) of this\nSection, and the court shall commit him to the custody of the director of the state\nDepartment of Health and Welfare for care and treatment at an appropriate facility of\nthe Department of Health and Welfare or, if the defendant is found to be dangerously\nmentally ill, to the Department of Corrections for a period not exceeding 90 days. A\ndefendant is considered dangerously mentally ill if he is in such mental condition that he\nneeds supervision, evaluation, treatment, and care and if he presents a substantial risk\nof physical harm to other persons as manifested by violent behavioral evidence. For\npurposes of this section \"facility\" shall mean a state hospital, institution, or mental\nhealth center equipped to evaluate or rehabilitate such defendants. The order of\ncommitment shall require the county sheriff to transport the defendant to and from the\nfacility and require an evaluation of the defendant's mental condition at the time of\nadmission to the facility, and a progress report on the defendant's mental condition.\nThe progress report shall include an opinion as to whether the defendant is fit to\nproceed or, if not, whether there is a substantial probability the defendant will be fit to\nproceed within the foreseeable future. If the report concludes that there is a substantial\nprobability that the defendant will be fit to proceed in the foreseeable future, the court\nmay order the continued commitment of the defendant for an additional 180 days. If at\nany time the director of the facility to which the defendant is committed determines\nthat the defendant is fit to proceed, such determination shall be reported to the court.\n(C) Each report shall be filed in triplicate with the clerk of the court, who shall deliver\ncopies to the prosecuting attorney and to counsel for the defendant. Upon receipt of a\nreport, the court shall determine, after a hearing if a hearing is requested, the\ndisposition of the defendant and the proceedings against him. If the court determines\nthat the defendant is fit to proceed, the proceeding shall be resumed. If at the end of\nthe initial 90, days the court determines that the defendant is unfit and there is not a\nsubstantial probability the defendant will be fit to proceed within the foreseeable future\nor if the defendant is not fit to proceed after the expiration of the additional 180,\ninvoluntary commitment proceedings shall be instituted pursuant to the laws of this\nstate in the court in which the criminal charge is pending.\n(D) In its review of commitments, the state Department of Health and Welfare shall\ndetermine whether the defendant is fit to proceed with trial. If the defendant is fit to\nproceed, the court in which the criminal charge is pending shall be notified and the\ncriminal proceedings may resume. If, however, the court is of the view that so much\ntime has elapsed (excluding any time spent free from custody by reason of the escape of\nthe defendant) since the commitment of the defendant that it would be unjust to\nresume the criminal proceeding, the court may dismiss the charge.\nSection 6. {Admissibility of statements by examined person.}\nA statement\nmade by a person subjected to psychiatric or psychological examination or treatment\npursuant to Sections 3, 4, or 7 of this Act, for the purposes of such examination or\ntreatment shall not be admissible in evidence in any criminal proceeding against him on\nany issue other than the defendant's ability to assist counsel at trial or to form any\nspecific intent which is an element of the crime charged, except that such statements of\na defendant to a psychiatrist or psychologist as are relevant for impeachment purposes\nmay be received subject to the usual rules of evidence governing matters of\nimpeachment.\nSection 7. {Forms of general verdict.}\nA general verdict upon a plea of not\nguilty is either \"guilty\" or \"not guilty,\" which imports a conviction or acquittal of the\noffense charged.\nSection 8. {Examination of defendant for evidence of mental condition;\nappointment of psychiatrists or licensed psychologists; hospitalization\nreports.}\n(A) If there is reason to believe the mental condition of the defendant will be a significant\nfactor at sentencing and for good cause shown, the court shall appoint at least one\npsychiatrist or licensed psychologist to examine and report upon the mental condition of\nthe defendant. The cost of examination shall be paid by the defendant if he or she is\nfinancially able. The determination of ability to pay shall be made in accordance with the\nlaws of this state governing provision of counsel to indigent defendants. The order\nappointing or requesting the designation of a psychiatrist or licensed psychologist shall\nspecify the issues to be resolved for which the examiner is appointed or designated.\n(B) In making such examinations, any method may be employed which is accepted by\nthe examiner's profession for the examination of those alleged to be suffering from a\nmental illness or defect.\n(C) The report of the examination shall include the following:\n\n(1) a description of the nature of the examination;\n(2) a diagnosis, evaluation or prognosis of the mental condition of the defendant;\n(3) an analysis of the degree of the defendant's illness or defect and level of functional impairment;\n(4) an assessment of whether treatment is available for the defendant's mental condition;\n(5) an analysis of the relative risks and benefits of treatment or non-treatment; and\n(6) an assessment of the risk of danger that the defendant may create to the public if at large.\n(D) The report of the examination shall be filed in triplicate with the clerk of the court,\nwho shall deliver copies to the prosecuting attorney and to counsel for the defendant.\n(E) When the defendant wishes to be examined by an expert of his own choice, such\nexaminer shall be permitted to have reasonable access to the defendant for the purpose\nof examination.\n(F) Nothing in this section is intended to limit the consideration of other evidence\nrelevant to the imposition of sentence.\nSection 9. {Consideration of mental illness in sentencing.}\n(A) Evidence of mental conditions shall be received, if offered, at the time of sentencing\nof any person convicted of a crime. In determining the sentence to be imposed in\naddition to other criteria provided by law, if the defendant's mental condition is a\nsignificant factor, the court shall consider such factors as:\n\n(1) the extent to which the defendant is mentally ill;\n(2) the degree of illness or defect and level of functional impairment;\n(3) the prognosis for improvement or rehabilitation;\n(4) the availability of treatment and level of care required;\n(5) any risk or danger that the defendant may create for the public, if at large, or the absence of such risk;\n(6) The capacity of the defendant to appreciate the wrongfulness of his or her conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law at the time of the offense charged.\n(B) The court shall authorize treatment during the period of confinement or probation\nspecified in the sentence if, after the sentencing hearing, it concludes by clear and\nconvincing evidence that:\n\n(1) the defendant suffers from a severe and reliably diagnosable mental illness or defect resulting in the defendant's inability to appreciate the wrongfulness of his or her conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law;\n(2) without treatment, the immediate prognosis is for major distress resulting in serious mental or physical deterioration of the defendant;\n(3) treatment is available for such illness or defect; and\n(4) the relative risks and benefits of treatment or non-treatment are such that a reasonable person would consent to treatment.\n(C) In addition to the authorization of treatment, the court shall pronounce sentence as\nprovided by law.\nSection 10. {Review of involuntary treatment.}\nThe state Board of Corrections\nshall adopt procedures ensuring that treatment plans are developed for patients at the\nfacility for whom the sentencing court has authorized treatment; that the relative risks\nand benefits or specific modes of treatment contained in such plans are explained, to\nthe extent possible, to each patient; that when treatment is given over the objection of a\npatient, there is a review of the decision to provide treatment independent of the\ntreating professional and that a statement explaining the reasons for giving treatment\nover objection of the patient shall be entered in the patient's treatment record over the\nsignature of the facility administrator.\nSection 11. {Transfer to non-correctional facilities.}\nPrisoners with a mental\nillness or defect committed to the Board of Corrections may be transferred to facilities of\nthe state Department of Health and Welfare in accordance with rules adopted jointly by\nthe two departments.\nSection 12. {Severability clause.}\nSection 13. {Repealer clause.}\nSection 14. {Effective date.}\n\nALEC's Sourcebook of American State Legislation 1995\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Many studies show that child abuse investigations are compromised when these very\ndifferent functions are not separated.\nD. Child abuse is a crime and suspected child abuse should be investigated with due\ndiligence by trained law enforcement officers.\nSection 3. Family Protection Unit\nA. Local child protection agencies shall transfer to or contract with law enforcement\nagencies to conduct investigations into all child abuse as defined by interagency\nagreement; and\nB.

The transfer will\ntake place only after the development of a transition plan that will insure the efficient\nand effective transfer of the powers and duties of the child-welfare agency to the law\nenforcement agency so that there is continuous service delivery to and protection of the\nchildren.\nB. Funds for providing child protective must be identified in the annual appropriation\nmade to the child-welfare agency which shall award grants for the full amount identified\nto the respective law enforcement agency. Funds for the child protective investigations\nmay not be integrated into the law enforcement agency’s regular budgets. Budgetary\ndata and other data relating to the performance of child protective investigations must\nbe maintained separately from all other records of the law enforcement agency.\nSection 7. Performance Outcomes\nA. The law enforcement agency shall submit reports regarding the administration of the\nchild abuse hotline and the conduct of child abuse investigations at least yearly or more\noften as determined by legislative committees.\nB.

      "billId": "Drug Dealer Liability Act Exposed",
      "billText": "\nSummary\nThis Act would provide an action for civil damages against persons who cause injury by\ntheir participation in the illegal drug market. The Act would also prescribe the parties\nand procedures regarding civil action.\n\nModel Legislation\n{Title, enacting clause, etc.}\nSection 1. {Title.}\nThis Act may be cited as the Drug Dealer Liability Act.\nSection 2. {Statement of purpose.}\nThe purpose of this Act is to provide a civil\nremedy for damages to persons in a community injured as a result of illegal drug use.\nThese persons include parents, employers, insurers, governmental entities, and others\nwho pay for drug treatment or employee assistance programs, as well as infants injured\nas a result of exposure to drugs in utero (\"drug babies\"). The Act will enable them to\nrecover damages from those persons in the community who have joined the illegal drug\nmarket. A further purpose of the Act is to shift, to the extent possible, the cost of the\ndamage caused by the existence of the illegal drug market in a community to those who\nillegally profit from that market. The further purpose of the Act is to establish the\nprospect of substantial monetary loss as a deterrent to those who have not yet entered\ninto the illegal drug distribution market. The further purpose is to establish an incentive\nfor drug users to identify and seek payment for their own drug treatment from those\ndealers who have sold drugs to the user in the past.\nSection 3. {Legislative findings.}\nThe legislature finds and declares all of the\nfollowing:\n(A) Every community in the country is affected by the marketing and distribution of\nillegal drugs. A vast amount of state and local resources are expended in coping with the\nfinancial, physical, and emotional toll that results from the existence of the illegal drug\nmarket. Families, employers, insurers, and society in general bear the substantial costs\nof coping with the marketing of illegal drugs. Drug babies and parents, particularly those\nof adolescent illegal drug users, suffer significant non-economic injury as well.\n(B) Although the criminal justice system is an important weapon against the illegal drug\nmarket, the civil justice system can and must also be used. The civil justice system can\nprovide an avenue of compensation for those who have suffered harm as a result of the\nmarketing and distribution of illegal drugs. The persons who have joined the illegal drug\nmarket should bear the cost of the harm caused by that market in the community.\n(C) The threat of liability under this Act serves as an additional deterrent to a\nrecognizable segment of the illegal drug network. A person who has non-drug-related\nassets, who markets illegal drugs at the workplace, who encourages friends to become\nusers, among others, is likely to decide that the added cost of entering the market is not\nworth the benefit. This is particularly true for a first-time, casual dealer who has not yet\nmade substantial profits. This Act provides a mechanism for the cost of the injury caused\nby illegal drug use to be borne by those who benefit from illegal drug dealing.\n(D) This Act imposes liability against all participants in the illegal drug market, including\nsmall dealers, particularly those in the workplace, who are not usually the focus of\ncriminal investigations. The small dealers increase the number of users and are the\npeople who become large dealers. These small dealers are most likely to be deterred by\nthe threat of liability.\n(E) A parent of an adolescent illegal drug user often expends considerable financial\nresources, typically in the tens of thousands of dollars, for the child's drug treatment.\nLocal and state governments provide drug treatment and related medical services made\nnecessary by the distribution of illegal drugs. The treatment of drug babies is a\nconsiderable cost to local and state governments. Insurers pay large sums for medical\ntreatment relating to drug addiction and use. Employers suffer losses as a result of illegal\ndrug use by employees due to lost productivity, employee drug-related workplace\naccidents, employer contributions to medical plans, and the need to establish and\nmaintain employee assistance programs. Large employers, insurers, and local and state\ngovernments have existing legal staffs that can bring civil suits against those involved in\nthe illegal drug market, in appropriate cases, if a clear legal mechanism for liability and\nrecovery is established.\n(F) Drug babies, who are clearly the most innocent and vulnerable of those affected by\nillegal drug use, are often the most physically and mentally damaged due to the\nexistence of an illegal drug market in a community. For many of these babies, the only\nhope is extensive medical and psychological treatment, physical therapy, and special\neducation. All of these potential remedies are expensive. These babies, through their\nlegal guardians and through court-appointed guardians ad litem, should be able to\nrecover damages from those in the community who have entered and participated in\nthe marketing of the types of illegal drugs that have caused their injuries.\n(G) In theory, civil actions for damages for distribution of illegal drugs can be brought\nunder existing law. They are not. Several barriers account for this. Under existing tort\nlaw, only those dealers in the actual chain of distribution to a particular user can be\nsued. Drug babies, parents of adolescent illegal drug users, and insurers are not likely to\nbe able to identify the chain of distribution to a particular user. Furthermore, drug\ntreatment experts largely agree that users are unlikely to identify and bring suit against\ntheir own dealers, even after they have recovered, given the present requirements for a\ncivil action. Recovered users are similarly unlikely to bring suit against others in the\nchain of distribution, even if they are known to the user. A user is unlikely to know other\ndealers in the chain of distribution. Unlike the chain of distribution for legal products, in\nwhich records identifying the parties to each transaction in the chain are made and\nshared among the parties, the distribution of illegal drugs is clandestine. Its participants\nexpend considerable effort to keep the chain of distribution secret.\n(H) Those involved in the illegal drug market in a community are necessarily interrelated\nand interdependent, even if their identity is unknown to one another. Each new dealer\nobtains the benefit of the existing illegal drug distribution system to make illegal drugs\navailable to him or her. In addition, the existing market aids a new entrant by the prior\ndevelopment of people as users. Many experts on the illegal drug market agree that all\nparticipants are ultimately likely to be indirectly related. That is, beginning with any one\ndealer, given the theoretical ability to identify every person known by that dealer to be\ninvolved in illegal drug trafficking, and in turn each of such others known to them, and\nso on, the illegal drug market in a community would ultimately be fully revealed.\n(I) Market liability has been created with respect to legitimate products by judicial\ndecision in some states. It provides for civil recovery by plaintiffs who are unable to\nidentify the particular manufacturer of the product that is claimed to have caused them\nharm, allowing recovery from all manufacturers of the product who participated in that\nparticular market. The market liability theory has been shown to be destructive of\nmarket initiative and product development when applied to legitimate markets. Because\nof its potential for undermining markets, this Act expressly adopts a legislatively crafted\nform of liability for those who intentionally join the illegal drug market. The liability\nestablished by this Act grows out of but is distinct from existing judicially crafted market\nliability.\n(J) The prospect of a future suit for the costs of drug treatment may drive a wedge\nbetween prospective dealers and their customers by encouraging users to turn on their\ndealers. Therefore, liability for those costs, even to the user, is imposed under this Act as\nlong as the user identifies and brings suit against his or her own dealers.\n(K) Allowing dealers who face a civil judgment for their illegal drug marketing to bring\nsuit against their own sources for contribution may also drive a wedge into the\nrelationships among some participants in the illegal drug distribution network.\n(L) While not all persons who have suffered losses as a result of the marketing of illegal\ndrugs will pursue an action for damages, at least some individuals, guardians of drug\nbabies, government agencies that provide treatment, insurance companies, and\nemployers will find such an action worthwhile. These persons deserve the opportunity to\nrecover their losses. Some new entrants to retail illegal drug dealing are likely to be\ndeterred even if only a few of these suits are actually brought.\nSection 4. {Definitions.}\nAs used in this Act:\n(A) \"Illegal drug\" means a drug whose distribution is a violation of state law.\n(B) \"Illegal drug market\" means the support system of illegal drug related operations,\nfrom production to retail sales, through which an illegal drug reaches the user.\n(C) \"Illegal drug market target community\" is the area described under Section 9.\n(D) \"Individual drug user\" means the individual whose illegal drug use is the basis of an\naction brought under this Act.\n(E) \"Level 1 offense\" means possession of 1/4 ounce or more, but less than four ounces,\nor distribution of less than one ounce of a specified illegal drug, or possession of one\npound or 25 plants or more, but less than four pounds or 50 plants, or distribution of\nless than one pound of marijuana.\n(F) \"Level 2 offense\" means possession of four ounces or more, but less than eight\nounces, or distribution of one ounce or more, but less than two ounces, of a specified\nillegal drug, or possession of four pounds or more or 50 plants or more, but less than\neight pounds or 75 plants, or distribution of more than one pound, but less than five\npounds, of marijuana.\n(G) \"Level 3 offense\" means possession of eight ounces or more, but less than 16\nounces, or distribution of two ounces or more, but less than four ounces, of a specified\nillegal drug or possession of eight pounds or more or 75 plants or more, but less than 16\npounds or 100 plants, or distribution of more than 5 pounds, but less than 10 pounds,\nof marijuana.\n(H) \"Level 4 offense\" means possession of 16 ounces or more or distribution of four\nounces or more of a specified illegal drug or possession of 16 pounds or more or 100\nplants or more or distribution of 10 pounds or more of marijuana.\n(I) \"Participate in the illegal drug market\" means to distribute, possess with an intent to\ndistribute, commit an act intended to facilitate the marketing or distribution of, or agree\nto distribute, possess with an intent to distribute, or commit an act intended to facilitate\nthe marketing and distribution of an illegal drug. \"Participate in the illegal drug market\"\ndoes not include the purchase or receipt of an illegal drug for personal use only.\n(J) \"Person\" means an individual, governmental entity, corporation, firm, trust,\npartnership, or incorporated or unincorporated association, existing under or authorized\nby the laws of this state, another state, or a foreign country.\n(K) \"Period of illegal drug use\" means, in relation to the individual drug user, the time of\nthe individual's first use of an illegal drug to the accrual of the cause of action.

This Act would require\nthat state and federal funds be further funneled through a state drug-free schools\nadvisory committee before reaching the schools.\nThe state Committee would be composed of a mix of law enforcement personnel, school\nofficials, treatment officials, and parents. This Act would also provide for the creation of\nlocal drug-free schools committees, which would have the same composition as the state\ncommittee.

      "billText": "\nSummary\nNarcotic analgesics have been extensively used in the management of pain. Through the\nuse of narcotics, patients have been spared a great deal of pain and suffering. In recent\nyears, advances and developments in pharmaceutical technology have led to the\ndevelopment of non-narcotic alternatives that have proven just as effective as narcotics,\nwithout the unintended central nervous system side effects, and without addictive\nproperties. Drug addiction and treatment expenses cost the state millions of dollars per\nyear. Patients covered under state Medicaid programs may not have access to these\nnewer products because of prior authorization or prior approval requirements.\nThis proposed legislation is designed to address a very narrow category of drug products\nused for the treatment of short-term, moderate pain states. This would assure that all\nMEDICAID patients have access to the best non-narcotic drug products available. All\nnon-narcotic drugs used for the short term management of pain would not be restricted\nby any prior approval or prior authorization requirements. All rebates required to be paid\nto the state pursuant to contract agreements with the Health Care Financing\nAdministration and/or the state, would remain in full force and effect.\nThe purpose of this Act is to assure access to non-narcotic medicines for the treatment\nof pain, without restriction, to state Medicaid patients, all individuals under the control of\nthe department of corrections or local jails, and all wards of the state.\n\nModel Legislation\n(Title, enhancing clause, etc.)\nSection 1. {Short Title}\nThis act may be cited as the Prescription Non-Narcotic\nAssured Access Act.\nSection 2. {Legislative Findings and Intent}\nThe Legislature finds and declares\nthat:\n(A) It is the policy of the state to reduce the use of narcotics within the MEDICAID\npopulation by making available to physicians prescription non-narcotic drugs that may\nbe prescribed for pain without prior approval or prior authorization.\n(B) The state finds that restricting access to non-narcotic drugs for the treatment of pain\navailable to Medicaid patients, all individuals under the control of the department of\ncorrections or local jails, and all wards of the state would restrict the availability of nonnarcotic\ndrugs and be an impediment to physicians who wish to prescribe non-narcotic\nmedications for Medicaid patients, all individuals under the control of the department of\ncorrections or local jails, and all wards of the state.\n(C) Requiring prior approval or prior authorization restricts the availability of non-narcotic\nmedicines for pain states which may have a damaging effect on medical care by forcing\nphysicians to rely more heavily on addictive narcotic analgesics.\n(D) The state finds that the illicit use of narcotics obtained fraudulently or illegally and\nsold as street drugs continues to be a formidable challenge and has a direct negative\neconomic impact on the state.\nSection 3.\n(A) The Department of Health Services [or insert appropriate state regulatory authority]\nshall make available to all MEDICAID patients, all individuals under the control of the\ndepartment of corrections or local jails, and all wards of the state, and not require any\nform of prior approval or prior authorization, all prescription pharmaceutical products\nthat meet the following criteria:\n\n(1) The medicine is approved for use by the United States Food &Drug Administration, and;\n(2) the medicine is used in the short term management of pain, and;\n(3) the medicine is non-narcotic.\n(B) The Department of Health Services [or insert appropriate state regulatory authority]\nto all MEDICAID patients any drug that meets the criteria listed in Section 3(a) within 60\ndays of when a drug receives an approved indication for the use in pain states or the\nmanagement of pain from the United States Food & Drug Administration, provided that:\n\n(1) the manufacturer of the drug has a contract with the state to provide drugs for MEDICAID patients and the manufacturer agrees to rebate the state an amount that conforms to the requirements of subsection (c) of Section 1396r-8 of Title 42 of the United States Code, or;\n(2) the manufacturer of the drug that does not have a contract with the state has a rebate contract in effect with the United States Health Care Finance Administration and rebates the state monies in accordance with the requirements of subsection (c) of Section 1396r-8 of the United States Code.\n(3) No drug shall be subject to these provisions unless (1) or (2) applies (get rid of if you keep either above).\nSection 4. {Severability Clause}\nSection 5. {Repealer Clause}\nSection 6. {Effective Date}\n\nALEC's Sourcebook of American State Legislation 1995\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

For the purposes of this subdivision, the licenses that are subject to suspension under this subdivision are all licenses that are held by the\nemployer specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer does not hold a license specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject to suspension under this subdivision are all licenses that are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the court's order and notwithstanding any other law, the appropriate agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the copy pursuant to subsection G of this section.\n\n(1)(d) May order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in subdivision (c) of this paragraph that are held by the employer for not to exceed ten business days.

On receipt of the order and notwithstanding any other law, the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.\n(3) The violation shall be considered:\n(a) A first violation by an employer at a business location if the violation did not occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under state law for that employer's business location.\n(b) A second violation by an employer at a business location if the violation occurred during a probationary period ordered by the court under state law for that employer's business location.\n(G) The attorney general shall maintain copies of court orders that are received\npursuant to subsection f of this section and shall maintain a database of the\nemployers and business locations that have a first violation of subsection A of this\nsection and make the court orders available on the attorney general's website.\n(H) On determining whether an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall\nconsider only the federal government's determination pursuant to 8 United States\nCode section 1373(c). The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable\npresumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may take judicial notice of\nthe federal government's determination and may request the federal government\nto provide automated or testimonial verification pursuant to 8 United States Code\nsection 1373(c).\n(I) For the purposes of this section, proof of verifying the employment\nauthorization of an employee through the e-verify program creates a rebuttable\npresumption that an employer did knowingly employ an unauthorized alien.\n(J) for the purposes of this section, an employer that establishes that it has\ncomplied in good faith with the requirements of 8 United States code section\n1324a(b) establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not knowingly\nemploy an unauthorized alien. an employer is considered to have complied with\nthe requirements of 8 United States code section 1324a(b), notwithstanding an\nisolated, sporadic or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the\nrequirements, if there is a good faith attempt to comply with the requirements.\nSection 7.{Verification of employment eligibility; E-verify program;\neconomic development incentives; list of registered employers.}\n(A) After [insert date], every employer, after hiring an employee, shall verify the\nemployment eligibility of the employee through the e verify program.\n(B) In addition to any other requirement for an employer to receive an economic\ndevelopment incentive from a government entity, the employer shall register with\nand participate in the e-verify program.

      "billText": "\nSection 1 {Purposes}\nThe purposes of this Act are to combat trafficking in persons;\nto protect victims of human trafficking, assist them in the rebuilding of their lives, and to\nrestore them to their inherent dignity; to ensure the just and effective punishment of\ntraffickers; and to create an environment in the State of [STATE] in which the abolition of\nhuman trafficking is effectuated.\nSection 2. {Findings}\nThe legislature finds that:\n(A) As a nation, our founding rests on the principle that all persons are created equal and\nendowed with certain unalienable rights that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit\nof happiness. We are at our best as a people when we are faithful to that principle and\nstruggle to realize its promise for all persons.\n(B) Throughout history, many regimes of power have used the law to countenance de\njure slavery, and have thereby denied the rights and inherent dignity of whole classes of\npeople.\n(C) Throughout history, persons of power and evil intent have isolated and coerced\nvulnerable individuals into exploitation, thereby preventing them from knowing or\nenforcing their rights. Sometimes these perpetrators have operated on the fringes of the\nlaw or have benefited from gaps in it, such as the restrictive common-law definition of\ncoercion requiring an imminent threat of physical harm.\n(D) The Thirteenth Amendment is an act to fulfill our founding principle. It mandates that\n“Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude . . . shall exist within the United States or any\nplace subject to their jurisdiction,” and it further obligates Congress to enforce that\nmandate with “appropriate legislation.” This state also has an affirmative obligation to\neradicate the badges and incidents of slavery.\n(E) Trafficking in persons is a modern-day manifestation of slavery. It consists of the\nexploitation of individuals in situations of commercial sex or forced labor for the purpose\nof financial gain.\n(F) The highest order of the state is to fulfill the promise of our founding principle. This\nfulfillment is achieved by, inter alia, restoring the liberty and inherent dignity of an\nindividual subjected to trafficking in persons.\n(G) Every year traffickers in persons prey on hundreds of thousands of people around the\nworld. Traffickers operate within or across international and state borders and usually\ntarget a society’s most vulnerable, most of whom are women and children. They subject\ntheir victims to exploitation through labor trafficking or commercial sex trafficking.\n(H) In this country and state, both US citizens and non-citizens fall prey to traffickers of\npersons.\n(I) Vulnerable people are often trafficked or maintained in trafficking because they do not\nknow their rights or do not know how to assert their rights.\n(J) Traffickers use various techniques to instill fear in victims and keep them enslaved.\nSome traffickers keep their victims under lock and key. More frequently, traffickers\nemploy less obvious techniques including, inter alia, isolating their victims from family\nand the public, confiscating passports, visas, driver’s licenses, or other identification\ndocuments, inflicting physical violence or the threat thereof against victims or their\nfamily, threatening to use legal processes against them or reporting them to law\nenforcement, immigration or juvenile authorities, fostering addiction, controlling their\naccess to addicted substances, and controlling their funds.\n(K) Many victims fear that their traffickers will exact retribution on their family members,\nwhether residing in this country or abroad.\n(L) Victims of human trafficking typically endure terrible physical and mental trauma.\nVictims often suffer from traumatic bonding (Stockholm Syndrome), post traumatic\nstress disorder (PTSD), and other conditions resulting from the psychological harm\ninflicted upon them. When rescued, the extent of this trauma must be recognized and\nassessed; victims need to be provided immediate access to stabilization services before\nthey can effectively contribute to the investigation of the crimes that have been\nperpetrated against them.\n(M) Due to the fear instilled in them by the traffickers, and to the experiences in foreign\ncountries from which they came, victims often have a profound suspicion of law\nenforcement and will not seek the protection of law enforcement officers and agencies.\n(N) Due to their fears and the psychological harms inflicted upon them, as noted in the\nUS State Department’s 2007 Trafficking in Persons Report, trafficking victims are unlikely\nto self-identify themselves as victims.\n(O) Within the context of interactions with authorities, victims of human trafficking must\nprimarily be recognized as the victims of a serious crime, and only secondarily as a\nwitness to a crime. As stated in the 2007 Trafficking in Persons Report:\nA government should provide efficient access to justice for these victims, if they so\nchoose, and access to shelter, medical care, legal aid, and psycho-social counseling.\nAs further stated in the 2007 Report:\n\nBy placing the needs of victims front and center, victims of this heinous crime are assured of the protection they so desperately need. Once given those assurances, many victims step forward voluntarily and without pressure to become powerful and confident witnesses….\n(P) Jurisprudence concerning the Thirteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution holds\nthat no person can consent to be enslaved, including agreement to debt bondage, nor\ncan a person under the age of 18 consent to participate in commercial sex.\n(Q) The federal Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 is an act that fulfills the promise\nof the Thirteenth Amendment at the national level. This Act seeks to fulfill that promise\nwithin the state of [STATE].\nSection 3. {Title _____ of the criminal code and Title _____ of the human\nservices code shall be amended as follows}:\nSection AAA.01 {Definitions}\nIn this Article:\n(A) “Blackmail” is to be given its ordinary meaning as defined by [state blackmail statute,\nif any] and includes but is not limited to a threat to convey or publish any fact or\npurported fact tending to subject any person to embarrassment, contempt, defamation,\nhatred, ridicule or worry.\n(B) “Coercion” means (a) threats of harm to or physical restraint against any person;

      "billId": "Comprehensive Asset Forfeiture Act Exposed",
      "billText": "\nSummary\nOver the past two decades, federal, state, and local law enforcement agents have relied\nincreasingly on asset forfeiture law “to take the profits out of crime.” Forfeiture has been\nan effective tool in the war on crime, but it has also led to corruption and abuse and to\nmany innocent owners losing their property in the name of fighting crime. Those abuses\nhave resulted in substantial media attention and have led many to take a closer look at\nthis body of law, especially since its principles and practices are so foreign to the rule of\nlaw and the American system of justice.\nReforming ALEC’s existing model bill on asset forfeiture to include common sense\nprotections that are vital to provide American citizens the protection that is guaranteed\nunder our Constitution will help prevent future abuses of a system that law enforcement\nneeds in its efforts to fight this country’s war on drugs.\n\nModel Legislation\n{Title, enacting clause, etc.}\nSection 1. {Title.}\nThis Act may be cited as the Comprehensive Asset Forfeiture Act.\nSection 2. {Creation of General Rules Relating to Civil Forfeiture\nProceedings.}\n(a)\n\n(1) In any nonjudicial civil forfeiture proceeding under a civil forfeiture statute, with respect to which the agency conducting a seizure of property must give written notice to interested parties, such notice shall be given as soon as practicable and in no case more than 60 days after the later of the date of the seizure or the date the identity of the interested party is first known or discovered by the agency, except that the court may extend the period for filing a notice for good cause shown.\n(2) A person entitled to written notice in such proceeding to whom written notice is not given may on motion void the forfeiture with respect to that person's interest in the property, unless the agency shows—\n(i) good cause for the failure to give notice to that person; or\n(ii) that the person otherwise had actual notice of the seizure.\n(3) If the Government does not provide notice of a seizure of property in accordance with subparagraph (a)(1), it shall return the property and may not take any further action to effect the forfeiture of such property.\n(b)\n\n(1) Any person claiming property seized in a nonjudicial forfeiture proceeding may file a claim with the appropriate official after the seizure.\n(2) A claim under subparagraph (a)(1) may not be filed later than 30 days after—\n(i) the date of final publication of notice of seizure; or\n(ii) in the case of a person entitled to written notice, the date that notice is received.\n(3) The claim shall state the claimant's interest in the property.\n(4) Not later than 90 days after a claim has been filed, the Attorney General shall file a complaint for forfeiture in the appropriate court or return the property, except that a court in the district in which the complaint will be filed may extend the period for filing a complaint for good cause shown or upon agreement of the parties.\n(5) If the Government does not file a complaint for forfeiture of property in accordance with subparagraph (b)(4), it shall return the property and may not take any further action to effect the forfeiture of such property.\n(6) Any person may bring a claim under subparagraph (a)(1) without posting bond with respect to the property that is the subject of the claim.\n(c)\n\n(1) In any case where the Government files in the appropriate State district court a complaint for forfeiture of property, any person claiming an interest in the seized property may file a claim asserting such person's interest in the property within 30 days of service of the Government's complaint or, where applicable, within 30 days of alternative publication notice.\n(2) A person asserting an interest in seized property in accordance with subparagraph (a)(1) shall file an answer to the Government's complaint for forfeiture within 20 days of the filing of the claim.\n(d)\n\n(1) If the person filing a claim is financially unable to obtain representation by counsel, the court may appoint counsel to represent that person with respect to the claim.\n(2) In determining whether to appoint counsel to represent the person filing the claim, the court shall take into account such factors as—\n(i) the claimant's standing to contest the forfeiture; and\n(ii) whether the claim appears to be made in good faith or to be frivolous.\n(3) The court shall set the compensation for that representation, which shall be equivalent to that provided for other court-appointed representation under state law.\n(e) In all suits or actions brought under any civil forfeiture statute for the civil forfeiture of\nany property, the burden of proof is on the State Government to establish, by clear and\nconvincing evidence, that the property is subject to forfeiture.\n(f)\n\n(1) An innocent owner's interest in property shall not be forfeited under any civil forfeiture statute.\n(2) With respect to a property interest in existence at the time the illegal conduct giving rise to forfeiture took place, the term `innocent owner' means an owner who—\n(i) did not know of the conduct giving rise to forfeiture; or\n(ii) upon learning of the conduct giving rise to the forfeiture, did all that reasonably could be expected under the circumstances to terminate such use of the property.\n(3) With respect to a property interest acquired after the conduct giving rise to the forfeiture has taken place, the term `innocent owner' means a person who, at the time that person acquired the interest in the property, was—\n(i)\n(I) a bona fide purchaser or seller for value (including a purchaser or seller of goods or services for value); or\n(II) a person who acquired an interest in property through probate or inheritance; and\n(ii) at the time of the purchase or acquisition reasonably without cause to believe that the property was subject to forfeiture.\n(4) Where the property subject to forfeiture is real property, and the claimant uses the property as the claimant's primary residence and is the spouse or minor child of the person who committed the offense giving rise to the forfeiture, an otherwise valid innocent owner claim shall not be denied on the ground that the claimant acquired the interest in the property--\n(i) in the case of a spouse, through dissolution of marriage or by operation of law; or\n(ii) in the case of a minor child, as an inheritance upon the death of a parent, and not through a purchase. However, the claimant must establish, in accordance with subparagraph (e)(3), that at the time of the acquisition of the property interest, the claimant was reasonably without cause to believe that the property was subject to forfeiture.\n(g) For the purposes of paragraph (f)—\n\n(1) ways in which a person may show that such person did all that reasonably can be expected may include demonstrating that such person, to the extent permitted by law--\n(i) gave timely notice to an appropriate law enforcement agency of information that led the person to know the conduct giving rise to a forfeiture would occur or has occurred; and\n(ii) in a timely fashion revoked or attempted to revoke permission for those engaging in such conduct to use the property or took reasonable actions in consultation with a law enforcement agency to discourage or prevent the illegal use of the property; and\n(2) in order to do all that can reasonably be expected, a person is not required to take steps that the person reasonably believes would be likely to subject any person (other than the person whose conduct gave rise to the forfeiture) to physical danger.\n(h) As used in this subsection:\n\n(1) The term `civil forfeiture statute' means any provision of State law providing for the forfeiture of property other than as a sentence imposed upon conviction of a criminal offense.\n(2) The term `owner' means a person with an ownership interest in the specific property sought to be forfeited, including a leasehold, lien, mortgage, recorded security device, or valid assignment of an ownership interest. Such term does not include—\n(i) a person with only a general unsecured interest in, or claim against, the property or estate of another;\n(ii) a bailee unless the bailor is identified and the bailee shows a colorable legitimate interest in the property seized; or\n(iii) a nominee who exercises no dominion or control over the property.\n(i)(1) A claimant under subsection (h) is entitled to immediate release of seized property if--\n(i) the claimant has a possessory interest in the property;\n(ii) the continued possession by the State Government pending the final disposition of forfeiture proceedings will cause substantial hardship to the claimant, such as preventing the functioning of a business, preventing an individual from working, or leaving an individual homeless; and\n(iii) the claimant's likely hardship from the continued possession by the State Government of the seized property outweighs the risk that the property will be destroyed, damaged, lost, concealed, or transferred if it is returned to the claimant during the pendency of the proceeding.\n(2) A claimant seeking release of property under this subsection must request possession of the property from the appropriate official, and the request must set forth the basis on which the requirements of paragraph (i)(1) are met.\n(3) If within 10 days after the date of the request the property has not been released, the claimant may file a motion or complaint in any district court that would have jurisdiction of forfeiture proceedings relating to the property setting forth--\n(i) the basis on which the requirements of paragraph (i)(1) are met; and\n(ii) the steps the claimant has taken to secure release of the property from the appropriate official.\n(4) If a motion or complaint is filed under paragraph (i)(3), the district court shall order that the property be returned to the claimant, pending completion of proceedings by the State Government to obtain forfeiture of the property, if the claimant shows that the requirements of paragraph (i)(1) have been met. The court may place such conditions on release of the property as it finds are appropriate to preserve the availability of the property or its equivalent for forfeiture.\n(5) The district court shall render a decision on a motion or complaint filed under paragraph (i)(3) no later than 30 days after the date of the filing, unless such 30-day limitation is extended by consent of the parties or by the court for good cause shown.\nSection 3. {Compensation for Damage to Seized Property.}\n(a) The State shall be liable for real costs of any claim based on the destruction, injury, or\nloss of goods, merchandise, or other property, while in the possession of any officer of\n[customs or] excise or any other law enforcement officer, if the property was seized for\nthe purpose of forfeiture under any provision of State law providing for the forfeiture of\nproperty other than as a sentence imposed upon conviction of a criminal offense but the\ninterest of the claimant is not forfeited'.\n(b) The Attorney General may settle, for not more than $50,000 in any case, a claim for\ndamage to, or loss of, privately owned property caused by an investigative or law\nenforcement officer who is employed by the State and acting within the scope of his or\nher employment.\n(2) LIMITATIONS- The Attorney General may not pay a claim under paragraph (1) that-\n\n(A) is presented to the Attorney General more than 1 year after it occurs; or\n(B) is presented by an officer or employee of the United States Government and arose within the scope of employment.\nSection 4. {Pre-Judgment and Post-Judgment Interest.}\n(a) INTEREST-\n\n(1) POST-JUDGMENT- Upon entry of judgment for the claimant in any proceeding to condemn or forfeit property seized or arrested under any provision of State law providing for the forfeiture of property other than as a sentence imposed upon conviction of a criminal offense, the State shall be liable for post-judgment interest as would have been earned in accordance with current interest rates.\n(2) PRE-JUDGMENT- The State shall not be liable for pre-judgment interest in a proceeding under any provision of State law providing for the forfeiture of property other than as a sentence imposed upon conviction of a criminal offense, except that in cases involving currency, other negotiable instruments, or the proceeds of an interlocutory sale, the State shall disgorge to the claimant any funds representing--\n(i) interest actually paid to the State from the date of seizure or arrest of the property that resulted from the investment of the property in an interest-bearing account or instrument; and\n(ii) for any period during which no interest is actually paid, an imputed amount of interest that such currency, instruments, or proceeds would have earned in accordance with the current interest rate.\n(3) LIMITATION ON OTHER PAYMENTS- The State shall not be required to disgorge the value of any intangible benefits in a proceeding under any provision of State law providing for the forfeiture of property other than as a sentence imposed upon conviction of a criminal offense nor make any other payments to the claimant not specifically authorized by this subsection.’\nSection 5. {Forfeiture of Property for Commission of Criminal Offense Procedure\nDisposition.}\n(a) Money, real property, vehicles and other conveyances, or tangible and intangible\npersonal property of any kind that is used in connection with the commission of a\ncriminal offense provided for in the {name of state} statutes is not subject or forfeiture\nunless it is owned by a person convicted of a criminal offense, it is ordered forfeited as\npart of the sentence imposed upon conviction, and a section of {name of state} law\nspecifically provides for forfeiture as part of the sentence imposed upon conviction. A civil\nforfeiture proceeding may not be used to proceed against property suspected of being\nused in connection with the commission of a criminal offense.\n(b) Unless another section of {name of state} statute specifically provides a procedure for\ndisposition of property forfeited as part of the sentence imposed upon conviction of a\ncriminal offense specified in that section, the forfeited property must be disposed of as\nprovided in this section.\n(c) The sheriff shall seize the forfeited property within ten (10) days after the conviction.\n(d) Forfeiture of property encumbered by a security interest is subject to the secured\nperson’s interest if the secured person did not know and could not have reasonably know\nof the unlawful possession, use, or other act in connection with the commission of the\ncrime.\n(e) If proper proof of a security interest is presented to the sheriff, the sheriff shall release\nthe property to the secured person if the amount due to the person is equal to or greater\nthan the value of the property.\n(f) Property not released to a secured person under subsection (e) must, except as\nprovided in subsection (g), be sold by the sheriff at a public auction in the same manner\nas provided by law for the sale of property under execution. The property may not be sold\nto an officer or employee of a law enforcement agency. The proceeds of the sale must be\ndistributed first to a secured person who has presented proper proof of the security\ninterest to the sheriff, and any remaining proceeds must be used to [insert appropriate\naction].\n(g) Property that is unlawful to produce or possess must be destroyed by the sheriff if it\ncannot be sold to a person or entity that can lawfully possess it.\nSection 6. {Applicability.}\n(a) IN GENERAL- Unless otherwise specified in this Act, this Act will apply with respect to\nclaims, suits, and actions filed on or after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n(b) EXCEPTIONS-\n\n(1) The standard for the required burden of proof set forth in section 2, shall apply in cases pending on the date of the enactment of this Act.\n(2) The amendment made by section 4 shall apply to any judgment entered after the date of the enactment of this Act.\nSection 7. {Severability Clause}\nSection 8. {Repealer Clause}\n\nAdopted by ALEC's Criminal Justice Task Force at the States and Nation Policy Summit\nDecember 9, 1999. \nApproved by full ALEC Board of Directors January, 2000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The sections of the\nmodel bill include language to enhance existing law with respect to the following:\nparental notification; false identification documents; serving, giving, purchasing for, or\nselling alcohol to persons under the legal drinking age; criminal liability for adults who\nenable underage drinking parties; prohibiting possession, consumption, and attempted\npurchase of alcohol by persons under the legal drinking age; guidelines for the use of\npersons under the legal drinking age in underage alcohol purchase investigations;\nestablishing consistent policies and sanctions for the possession and use of alcohol on\nschool property for a school which includes any grades K-12 or while attending a school\nfunction by persons under the legal drinking age.\nSection 4 addresses parental notification and is based on surveys and studies indicating\nthat parents are the primary influence on their children’s decisions and that parental\ninvolvement is essential in supporting a young person’s efforts to seek and obtain basic\nsupport and encouragement as well as any appropriate professional assistance.\nSection 5 addresses the manufacture, sale, use, attempted use, and possession of false\nIDs for the purpose of illegally obtaining alcohol beverages. This area requires additional\nattention in part to simplify administration of justice and in part to recognize the\nprevalence of the use of false identification and specifically address different methods\nthat underage persons use to illegally purchase alcohol. This subject should be fully\naddressed within the state alcohol beverage code in conjunction with provisions\nestablishing the legal drinking age.\nSection 6 addresses the issue of adults above the legal drinking age furnishing alcohol to\npersons under the legal drinking age and is based on a number of studies that indicate\nthat a substantial majority of the alcohol consumed by those under the legal drinking age\nis provided by parents, siblings, co-workers, fellow students, or other adults of legal\ndrinking age.\nSection 7 addresses situations where adults above the legal drinking age knowingly make\ntheir property available for parties at which alcohol is consumed by persons under the\nlegal drinking age. According to law enforcement officers, specific legislative sections\nshould address those who host or knowingly permit illegal underage drinking to occur on\nproperty they own or control.\nSection 8 is a concise and comprehensive formulation of a prohibition on possession,\nconsumption, purchase, and attempted purchase of alcohol by persons under the legal\ndrinking age with penalties.\nSection 9 is a codification of standards for the use of persons under the legal drinking age\nin law enforcement investigations or compliance checks of licensees.\nSection 10 is an effort to align alcohol policies in schools that include any grades K-12 in\nsupport of the state’s laws establishing the legal drinking age.\n\nModel Legislation\nSection 1. {Short title}\nUnderage Drinking Prevention and Enforcement\nAmendment/Act\nSection 2. {Legislative Declaration}\nThe purpose of this amendment/act is to\nreduce the purchase, possession, and consumption of alcohol by persons under the legal\ndrinking age.\nSection 3. {Findings}\nThe {Insert Name of Legislative Body} of this State makes the\nfollowing findings:\n(A) According to government and reliable independent research, such as from the\nUniversity of Michigan, Monitoring the Future Study; National Highway Traffic Safety\nAdministration, U.S. Dept. of Transportation; and Partnership for a Drug Free America,\nsignificant reductions in incidents of illegal underage drinking and related harms have\noccurred through the tireless efforts of [insert name of state] and local law enforcement\nand the active support of innumerable concerned citizens and responsible licensees doing\nbusiness in [name of state]. Those efforts to effectively combat illegal underage drinking\ninclude a comprehensive system approach; the elements of which are sound laws, strict\nenforcement, even-handed adjudication, and state-wide education.\n(B) To sustain and further the progress achieved to date, enhancements are required to\naddress the purchase, possession, and consumption of alcohol by persons under the legal\ndrinking age, a significant number of whom continue to violate the laws of [name of\nstate] posing unacceptable risks to their health and safety and that of all citizens. The\n[name of legislature] finds that amendments based on recent and credible policy\nresearch are warranted in the following areas [edit list as appropriate to the needs of the\nspecific state]:\n\n(1) Parental notification;\n(2) Manufacture, sale, possession, display, use, or attempted use of false identification to illegally obtain alcohol beverages;\n(3) Adults serving, giving, or selling alcohol beverages to or purchasing alcohol beverages for persons under the legal drinking age;\n(4) The hosting of parties on public or private property at which underage persons are permitted or encouraged to illegally consume alcohol by adults of legal drinking age;\n(5) Possession, consumption, and attempted purchase of alcohol beverages by persons under the legal drinking age;\n(6) Guidelines for use of persons under the legal drinking age in investigations; and\n(7) Effective K-12 school district alcohol policies that support underage drinking laws.\nSection 4. {Parental Notification}\n(A) When a person under age 18 is cited or arrested for a violation of [insert appropriate\nsections of state law], the law enforcement agency employing the arresting officer [or the\ncourt arraigning the person or adjudicating the charges] shall make a reasonable attempt\nto notify such person's custodial parent or guardian of the citation, arrest, or conviction.\n(Cf.

      "billId": "Statement of Principles on Federally Mandated Blood Alcohol Levels (BAC) and Drunk Driving Sanctions Exposed",
      "billText": "\nThe American Legislative Exchange Council finds the following:\nFederal Funding and Mandates\nOur nation’s system of governance is based on a unique delicate balance between the\nfederal government and the governments of the states. This balance is founded on the\nbelief that each is a co-equal branch of government with clearly enumerated and\ndistinct duties and responsibilities.\nState officials have a duty and a vested interest in ensuring their roadways are as safe as\npossible for their citizens.\nKnowing their states unique characteristics, state lawmakers are in the best position to\nset the appropriate safety standards. State lawmakers have a closer relationship then\nfederal lawmakers with the citizens they represent and are in a position to directly\nrespond to their concerns.\nFederally imposed standards upset the balance between Washington and the states.\nFederally imposed standards force a “one-size-fits-all” approach that ignores local needs\nand concerns. Federally imposed standards also ignore the valuable experience of\npersons most familiar with a state’s needs. The policies of the states are the result of a\ndeliberative process of state lawmakers, acting on behalf of their citizens.\nFederal highway funding is financed through various excise taxes paid by citizens into\nthe Federal Highway Trust Fund. This funding is complemented by state funding, based\non state excise taxes and fees. Taxpayers and the states deserve the maximum funding\nfrom this Trust Fund. The federal government should not withhold highway funding as a\nleverage to force a state to adopt or change its policy.\nIf states are forced to adopt a federally mandated policy, additional resources should be\ncommitted to the state to cover compliance and administrative costs\nBlood Alcohol Content (BAC) Levels\nEach state, through the deliberative legislative process, has the power set blood alcohol\ncontent (BAC) level at which a driver is considered legally intoxicated. Thirty-four states\ncurrently enforce a 0.10 BAC level and sixteen states enforce a 0.08 BAC level.\nState officials, acting on behalf of citizens, are in the best position to determine the\nappropriate BAC level for this state. They have the ability to adjust this level as needed.\nAny effort that would shift this power to the federal government is a severe violation of\nstate’s rights and should be terminated.\nFocusing Sanctions\nWhen determining the focus of drunk driving sanctions or any other government\nregulation policymakers should ensure that the focus of such sanctions impacts the\ntargeted violators and avoids burdening the law abiding citizen.\nA driver with BAC levels of 0.15 or higher is 380 times more likely to be involved in a\ncrash than a non drinking driver. In 1997, 58 percent of drivers involved in alcohol\nrelated traffic fatalities had BAC levels of 0.15 or higher, significantly higher than any\nstate’s legal limits.\nEach year as many as 40 percent of fatally injured drivers have been previously\nconvicted of DWI. Of these 80 percent have BAC levels of 0.15 or higher.\nIt is these “hardcore” drunk drivers that consistently drive with high BAC levels despite\nprevious convictions that should be the target of drunk driving sanctions. Although the\n“hardcore” drunk drivers make up a relatively small group of drivers they continue to\naccount for a substantial portion of drinking and driving problems.\nSanctions that focus on keeping the “hardcore” drunk driver off the roadways will have\nthe most significant impact in reducing drunk driving accidents and fatalities.\nLegislative Actions\nWhen implementing sanctions to counter the hardcore drunk driver, states should\ncoordinate existing laws and close existing loopholes. Measures should be taken to form\na comprehensive system that ensures that offenders are charged at the proper level and\nassure that separate sanctions are connected and reinforced.\nThe establishment of a reliable statewide DWI reporting system would ensure that\nmultiple offenders are not treated as first time offenders, a common error due to the lack\nof data.\nAdopted by ALEC's Trade & Transportation Task Force March, 1999. \nApproved by full ALEC Board of Directors April 22, 1999.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

In states where there are eavesdropping laws to obtain court orders for electronic\nsurveillance, these laws should be added to the list of “designated offenses.” Similarly, states that\nhave racketeering laws should include these crimes as a “predicate offense” for their RICO laws.\nThe role of organized crime is inextricably interwoven into these illicit activities. Specifically,\nthe clone phone is the communications tool of choice for today’s criminal entrepreneur.\nAccordingly, eavesdropping and racketeering strategies are critically important to the\nprosecutor’s arsenal of containment tools. These amendments can be easily proposed and viewed\nas conforming legislation.\n2. ALEC recommends and invites state and local law enforcement agencies to work with the\nprivate sector and make this issue a law enforcement priority.\n[1]Some states permit identical sanctions for “access” and “attempted access.” If your state\npermits identical sanctions, this statute shall apply, If not, you may wish to create a separate\nsection to delineate penalties for “attempted access.”\n[2]“Cause is the preferred term.
