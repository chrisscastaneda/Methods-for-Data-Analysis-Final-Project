The bill revises several rules to allow certain types of notice to be served by electronic means in addition to the means allowed under the current rules, which are personal service and service by certified mail.  The bill also eliminates an outdated provision in the rules regarding faculty holding appointments under a statutory law that was repealed in 1974.  The bill modifies certain rules to be consistent with statutory changes made by the 2015 biennial budget act, 2015 Wisconsin Act 55.  The act replaced the statutory term \"classified staff\" with \"university staff.\"  The bill makes similar changes to the board's rules.  The bill also removes references in the rules to a statute regarding faculty tenure and probationary appointments that was repealed by the act.\n\nIn addition, the bill also modifies the rules to refer to the UW System's 2-year schools as \"colleges,\" instead of the outdated term \"centers.\"  Also, the bill modifies the rules to define \"chancellor\" as the chief executive officer of an \"institution,\" which is defined in a rule not affected by the bill as any university or an organizational equivalent designated by the board.

DHS must implement the MA programs and services in Milwaukee, Racine, Kenosha, Rock, and Dane counties and in a rural multicounty region identified by DHS in collaboration with the Great Lakes Intertribal Council.  The bill specifies certain services or programs that DHS must consider including in its Medicaid waiver request.  DHS must evaluate the programs and services implemented under the waiver request and must develop a plan to implement the effective programs and services statewide.  DHS must also consider prohibiting reimbursement under the MA program for elective induction of labor or cesarean sections performed before 39 weeks gestation, unless medically indicated.\n\nUnder federal law, the earned income tax credit (EITC) is a refundable tax credit that may be claimed by low-income workers.  If the amount of the claim for the credit exceeds the worker's tax liability, the claimant receives a check for the excess amount from the Internal Revenue Service.  The amount of the credit for which a claimant is eligible is based, in part, on the claimant's filing status and whether the claimant has no qualifying children, one qualifying child, or more than one qualifying child.\n\nUnder current law, the refundable Wisconsin EITC may be claimed in an amount equal to a certain percentage of the federal EITC.  To be eligible for the Wisconsin EITC, an individual must have one or more qualifying children who have the same principal place of abode as the claimant.\n\nUnder this bill, an individual may claim the Wisconsin EITC even if, with regard to the child about whom the claim is made, the child does not have the same principal place of abode as the claimant and even if another person claims the federal and Wisconsin credits for that child, provided that the claimant meets a statutory definition of \"parent\" with respect to that child and provided that the claimant is subject to and in compliance with a child support order with respect to that child.\n\nWritten agreements required for nurse-midwives\n\nUnder current law, the Board of Nursing licenses nurse-midwives.  Nurse-midwives are health care professionals authorized to practice nurse-midwifery, which is defined as the management of women's health care, pregnancy, childbirth, postpartum care for newborns, family planning, and gynecological services consistent with the standards of practice of the American College of Nurse-Midwives and the education, training, and experience of the nurse-midwife.\n\nA nurse-midwife may only practice nurse-midwifery in a health care facility approved by the Board of Nursing, in collaboration with a physician with postgraduate training in obstetrics, and pursuant to a written agreement with that physician.  A nurse-midwife who discovers evidence that any aspect of care involves any complication that jeopardizes the health or life of a newborn or mother (serious complication) must consult with the collaborating physician or the collaborating physician's designee, or make a referral as specified in the written agreement with the collaborating physician.\n\nThis bill does the following with respect to these provisions governing nurse-midwives:\n\n1.  Eliminates the restriction providing that a nurse-midwife may only practice in collaboration with a physician with postgraduate training in obstetrics.\n\n2.  Provides that, in the case of a serious complication, the nurse-midwife must instead consult with a qualified health care professional (QHP), as defined in the bill, or make a referral to a QHP.\n\nHospital staff privileges for nurse-midwives and coverage of nurse-midwives under the injured patients and families compensation fund\n\nUnder current law, certain health care providers (covered health care providers), who meet certain criteria, are covered by the injured patients and families compensation fund (fund) for claims for damages for bodily injury or death due to acts or omissions of those covered health care providers.  Any claims filed against a covered health care provider must follow the procedures and are subject to the restrictions in current law.\n\nCovered health care providers, under current law, are required to maintain certain liability insurance or to qualify as a self-insurer.  The insurance policy under which a covered health care provider is covered must meet certain requirements under current law.  If the covered health care provider satisfies the requirements of current law, he or she is liable for malpractice for no more than the prescribed limits of a self-insured covered health care provider or no more than the maximum liability limit for which the covered health care provider is insured.  The fund pays any portion of a medical malpractice claim against a covered health care provider that is in excess of the self-insured limits or the liability insurance limit, except if the damages for injury or death are caused by an intentional crime.  Covered health care providers pay an annual assessment, which is deposited in the fund.\n\nThe bill adds nurse-midwives to the law pertaining to the fund and to the malpractice claims, and therefore, under the bill, nurse-midwives are covered by the fund and are subject to the restrictions to be covered by the fund.\n\nStatewide systems for public assistance programs\n\nCurrently, DHS administers an electronic application and information system that enables a person to determine his or her eligibility for and register for multiple public assistance programs, including BadgerCare Plus, the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program, and FoodShare. This bill requires DHS to expand the current electronic application and information system to include information regarding all programs designed to assist low-income persons, including housing assistance, rental assistance, and temporary child care assistance.\n\nThe bill also requires DHS to develop a statewide electronic data management and information system for all public assistance programs.  Under the bill, the system must allow a person to register for multiple public assistance programs with a single application or registration.  The system must also allow an administrator of a public assistance program to access data related to an individual that was previously collected for purposes of a different public assistance program.  Finally, the system must provide automated individual care plans that identify service activities to address assessed risks and include a scheduling or referral component that identifies available providers for individuals' service needs.\n\nInformed consent for certain elective caesarean section and labor-inducing procedures\n\nUnder current law, a physician who treats a patient must inform the patient about the availability of reasonable alternate medical modes of treatment and about the benefits and risks of those treatments.  A physician who violates this requirement is guilty of unprofessional conduct and may be subject to discipline by the Medical Examining Board (MEB), which may warn or reprimand the physician, or limit, suspend, or revoke his or her license to practice medicine and surgery.  Current law requires the MEB to promulgate rules implementing these informed consent requirements.\n\nThe bill specifically prohibits a physician from performing an elective cesarean section on a pregnant woman, and prohibits a physician or a nurse-midwife from performing an elective procedure intended to induce labor in a pregnant woman, before the completion of a gestational period of 39 weeks unless the physician has first obtained the informed consent of the woman.  The bill provides that a woman's consent is informed only if she receives timely information orally and in person from the physician or nurse-midwife regarding potential negative effects to the fetus of early delivery, including long-term learning and behavioral problems.  Under the bill, a physician who violates the prohibition in the bill is guilty of unprofessional conduct and may be subject to the same disciplinary consequences as violations of the informed consent provisions under current law.  The Board of Nursing may similarly revoke, limit, suspend, or deny renewal of the license of a nurse-midwife who violates the prohibition.  The bill directs the MEB to promulgate rules implementing the provisions of the newly created prohibition and directs both the MEB and the Board of Nursing to promulgate rules defining \"elective\" for purposes of the prohibition in the bill.\n\nEvidence-based home visitation services\n\nUnder current law, the Department of Children and Families (DCF) administers the Child Abuse and Neglect Prevention Program under which DCF awards grants to counties, private agencies, and Indian tribes that offer voluntary home visitation services to parents who are eligible for MA and who are at risk of poor birth outcomes or of perpetrating child abuse or neglect.  Current law requires a grant applicant to provide information on how the applicant's home visitation program incorporates:  1) practice standards that have been developed for home visitation programs by entities concerned with the prevention of poor birth outcomes and child abuse and neglect; and 2) practice standards and critical elements that have been developed for successful home visitation programs by a nationally recognized home visitation program model.\n\nThis bill specifies that home visitation program services provided by a county, private agency, or Indian tribe under a child abuse and neglect prevention grant from DCF must be evidence-based.  The bill also requires DCF to enter into a memorandum of understanding with DHS that provides for collaboration between DCF and DHS in carrying out those evidence-based home visitation program services.\n\nNeonatal intensive care unit reports\n\nThe bill requires DHS to collect all of the following information from a hospital that has a neonatal intensive care unit:  1) the daily census of the neonatal intensive care unit; and 2) the criteria for admission to the neonatal intensive care unit.  DHS must annually prepare a report that includes all of the information collected from hospitals from the previous calendar year.  DHS must make the reports available to the public and post the report on its Internet site.\n\nBest practices for postpartum patients and newborns at hospitals\n\nThe bill requires DHS to promulgate rules requiring hospitals to ensure that best practices for postpartum patients and newborns are supported in the hospital, including rules that:  1) require hospitals to develop, for each postpartum patient, an appropriate discharge plan that ensures that, to the extent practicable, an appointment with a health care provider has been scheduled for the newborn within an appropriate time after discharge and that the postpartum patient is consulted and provided with assistance regarding health care resources and safe transportation for the newborn; 2) require, prior to discharge from the hospital, that education be provided, orally and in person, to each postpartum patient on certain topics; and 3) require that health care providers, including physicians, recommend and actively support breastfeeding for all newborns for whom breastfeeding is not medically contraindicated; provide parents with complete, up-to-date information to ensure that feeding decisions are fully informed; and provide, upon a parent's request, referrals to lactation specialists or public health nurses for home visits.\n\nCultural competency training for students at higher educational institutions\n\nThe bill directs the University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents and the Technical College System Board to ensure that students enrolled in health care or social work programs receive training in cultural competency to improve patient-centered care.\n\nIndication of race on birth certificates\n\nThe bill requires a birth certificate to include the race and ethnicity of the child, as reported by the mother of the registrant, and requires DHS to promulgate rules establishing designations of race and ethnicity to be used for reporting race and ethnicity.  The bill provides that the designations must be sufficiently detailed to enable compilation and analysis of data related to births and birth outcomes among all significant racial and ethnic populations in the state and to assist in the design and evaluation of programs and policies designed to improve birth outcomes. In addition, the rules must establish procedures to ensure that the racial and ethnic designations included on each certificate of birth accurately reflect the race and ethnicity of the registrant as directly reported by the child's mother.\n\nFetal and infant mortality and birth outcome report\n\nThe bill requires DHS to annually prepare a report relating to fetal and infant mortality and birth outcomes in this state.  The report must include data related to births and birth outcomes in this state in the previous calendar year and an analysis of that data.  DHS must collaborate with local health departments, tribes, and other interested parties about the data and the report.  DHS must ensure that the report, to the greatest extent possible, includes data and analysis that are necessary and useful for the development and evaluation of programs to address disparities in birth outcomes among racial and ethnic groups in this state and must periodically consult with interested parties to review and update the data and analysis to be included in the report as needed to ensure that this goal continues to be met.\n\nDHS must include certain specified information about infant births and deaths in the annual report and must, in collaboration with the aforementioned persons and entities, consider including in the report data related to the type of prenatal care, if any, received by the mother of each infant whose birth data is included in the report.\n\nDHS must annually submit the report to the appropriate standing committees of the legislature; post the report on its Internet site; and post, on its Internet site, the raw data used for the report in a manner that does not disclose or enable the identification of any individual infant, mother, or birth attendant.\n\nFinally, DHS must explore whether any of the costs of collecting the data and creating the annual report may be funded by the MA program.\n\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB852,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  36.25 (54) of the statutes is created to read:\n            Down\r\n        Down\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Up\r\n        Up\r\nAB852,7,102\n36.25 (54)  Cultural competency training.

The exceptions include certain hands-free and emergency-related use.\n\nCurrent law prohibits inattentive driving of a motor vehicle, which means that a driver of a motor vehicle may not be engaged or occupied with an activity, other than driving the vehicle, that interferes with the safe driving of the vehicle.  Current law also specifically prohibits, with certain exceptions, a person from driving while composing or sending an electronic text message.  Persons who violate either of these prohibitions may be required to forfeit not less than $20 nor more than $400.  Also under current law, a person driving under an instruction permit or a probationary license is prohibited from driving a motor vehicle while using a cellular phone, except to report an emergency.  Persons who violate this prohibition may be required to forfeit not less than $20 nor more than $40 for a first offense, and not less than $50 nor more than $100 for a second or subsequent offense within one year.\n\nThis bill prohibits any person from driving while using a cellular phone.  Except in certain cases involving persons driving under an instruction permit or a probationary license, the prohibition does not apply to any of the following:  1) operators of authorized emergency vehicles; 2) use of certain emergency alert or vehicle monitoring devices; 3) use of global positioning system devices; 4) certain amateur radio operators; 5) certain use of hands-free telephones; and 6) use in response to an emergency.  Persons who violate this prohibition may be required to forfeit not less than $20 or more than $400.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB853,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  346.89 (4) (a) of the statutes, as affected by 2015 Wisconsin Act .... 2(Senate Bill 158), is renumbered 346.89 (4) (a) 1. and amended to read:\nAB853,2,63\n346.89 (4) (a) 1.

This bill also makes a number of changes to the law governing the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program, the Racine Parental Choice Program, and the statewide parental choice program (parental choice programs).  The changes are to take effect in the 2016-17 school year.\n\nMedicaid expansion\n\nThe bill changes the family income eligibility level to up to 133 percent of the federal poverty line for parents and caretaker relatives under BadgerCare Plus (BC+) and for childless adults under BC+ Core.  Currently, DHS administers the Medical Assistance (MA) program, which is a joint federal and state program that provides health services to individuals who have limited financial resources.  Some MA services are provided through programs that operate under a waiver of federal Medicaid laws, including services provided through the BadgerCare Plus (BC+) and BadgerCare Plus Core (BC+ Core) programs.  The federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act allows a state to receive an enhanced federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) payment for providing benefits to certain individuals through a state's MA program.  The bill requires DHS to comply with all federal requirements and to request any amendment to the state MA plan, waiver of Medicaid law, or other federal approval necessary to qualify for the highest available enhanced FMAP for parents and caretaker relatives and childless adults eligible for BC+ Core.\n\nFamily income for pupil eligibility\n\nCurrent law permits a pupil to attend a participating private school under the Racine Parental Choice Program or the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program if the pupil resides in the Racine Unified School District (RUSD) or the Milwaukee Public School District (MPS), respectively, and the family income of the pupil does not exceed three times the federal poverty level.  Current law also permits a pupil who resides in a school district other than RUSD or MPS to attend a participating private school if the family income of the pupil does not exceed 1.85 times the federal poverty level.  Under each parental choice program, if the family income of a pupil who is attending a private school under the program increases, the pupil may continue to attend a private school under the program.\n\nUnder this bill, beginning in the 2016-17 school year, no pupil whose family income exceeds 1.85 times the federal poverty level may attend a participating private school under any of the parental choice programs.  The bill makes no changes to the provisions governing a pupil who is attending a private school under the program and whose family income increases.\n\nPer pupil payments\n\nUnder current law, beginning in the 2015-16 school year, the maximum per pupil payment in any given school year is equal to the maximum per pupil payment in the previous school year plus the revenue limit per pupil adjustment, if positive, provided to school districts in the current year plus the change in total categorical aid funding per pupil, if positive, from the prior year to the current year.\n\nThis bill eliminates this method for determining per pupil payments to participating private schools.  Under this bill, beginning in the 2016-17 school year, for each pupil enrolled in a private school under a parental choice program, the department must pay the lesser of the following: a) the private school's per pupil eligible education expenses; b) a rolling average of the tuition paid by a pupil attending the private school, but not under a parental choice program, in the current and two preceding school years; or c) $6,442.\n\nTeacher licensure\n\nWith certain exceptions, current law requires that the teachers and administrators employed by a private school participating in a parental choice program have at least a bachelor's degree from an accredited institution of higher education.  The teachers and administrators are not required to be licensed by the department.\n\nWith certain exceptions, this bill requires that all instructional staff of private schools participating in a parental choice program hold a license or permit issued by the department.  \"Instructional staff\" means all professional employees who have as part of their responsibility direct contact with pupils or with the private school's instructional program.\n\nBackground investigations of teachers and administrators\n\nUnder current law, the state superintendent of public instruction (state superintendent) must, with the assistance of the Department of Justice (DOJ), conduct a background investigation of each applicant for issuance or renewal of a license or permit.  Current law requires the state superintendent to revoke a license issued to an individual (licensee) by the state superintendent for incompetency or immoral conduct on the part of the licensee; if the licensee is convicted of certain Class A, B, C, D, E, F, G, or H felonies or certain other crimes or violations, including sex offenses; or if the licensee is liable for delinquent taxes or is delinquent in making court-ordered payments of child or family support payments.\n\nThis bill requires each private school participating in a parental choice program to conduct a background check of each teacher and administrator employed by the private school on the effective date of the bill.  The bill also requires each participating private school to conduct a background check prior to extending an offer of employment to an individual who applies to teach in or serve as an administrator of the private school.  Finally, the bill requires the private school to annually conduct a background check of each teacher and administrator employed by the private school.  The bill prohibits a participating private school from employing a teacher or administrator who would not be eligible for employment in a public school for any of the reasons identified above.  The bill also authorizes the state superintendent to immediately terminate a private school's participation in a parental choice program if the owner of the private school would not be eligible for employment for any of the reasons identified above or if the private school employs a teacher or administrator without conducting a background check or the teacher or administrator would be ineligible to be licensed for any of the reasons identified above.\n\nReading readiness assessments of participating pupils\n\nUnder current law, each school board and the governing body of each independent charter school must assess each pupil enrolled in four-year-old kindergarten to second grade for reading readiness or grade-level reading achievement.\n\nThis bill extends this requirement to private schools participating in a parental choice program.  The requirement applies only to those pupils attending the private school under the program.  The bill also authorizes the state superintendent of public instruction to issue an order barring a private school from participating in a parental choice program for the current school year if it violates the requirement described above.\n\nCriteria for awarding a high school diploma to participating pupils\n\nCurrent law requires the governing body of each private school participating in a parental choice program to develop a policy specifying criteria for granting a high school diploma to pupils attending the school under the program.  The criteria must include the pupil's academic performance and the recommendations of teachers.  The private school may not grant a high school diploma to any pupil attending the school under the program unless the pupil satisfies the criteria specified in the policy.\n\nBeginning in the 2016-17 school year, this bill requires a private school participating in a parental choice program to include in its policy the requirements for granting a high school diploma applicable to public school pupils.  These requirements include earning a specified minimum number of credits in certain subjects and, in grades 9 to 12, being enrolled in a class or participating in an activity approved by the school board during each class period of each school day.\n\nThe bill also authorizes the state superintendent of public instruction to issue an order barring a private school from participating in a parental choice program for the current school year if the private school fails to include these new requirements in its high school graduation policy.\n\nCorporal punishment of pupils enrolled in a participating private school\n\nUnder current law, no official, employee, or agent of a school district (school employee) may subject a pupil enrolled in the school district to corporal punishment.  Current law defines corporal punishment to mean \"the intentional infliction of physical pain which is used as a means of discipline.\"  Current law permits a school employee to use reasonable and necessary force under certain circumstances, including to obtain possession of a weapon from a pupil, protect the safety of others, or quell a disturbance.  Each school board must establish a policy to outline the circumstances in which a school employee may use reasonable and necessary force.\n\nThis bill extends these provisions regarding corporal punishment to private schools participating in a parental choice program, and permits the state superintendent to issue an order barring the private school from participating in a parental choice program for the current school year if the private school fails to comply with these provisions.\n\nExpulsion of pupils from participating private schools\n\nUnder current law, a pupil may be expelled from a public school for repeatedly violating school rules; making a bomb threat; or endangering or threatening to endanger the property, health, or safety of others.  A pupil who has a firearm at school must be expelled for at least one year.  Before expelling a pupil, the school board must provide a hearing at which the pupil or his or her parent may be represented by an attorney.  After the hearing, the school board must issue a written decision, which may be appealed to the state superintendent of public instruction.\n\nThis bill directs the department to promulgate rules establishing a procedure for the expulsion of pupils attending a private school under a parental choice program by the governing body of the private school.  The rules must adhere as closely as feasible to the statutory provisions governing the expulsion of pupils from public schools.\n\nThe bill also authorizes the state superintendent to issue an order barring a private school from participating in a parental choice program for the current school year if the private school violates the rules described above.\n\nRegular building inspection of certain participating private schools\n\nUnder current law, before a private school may participate in a parental choice program, the private school must submit to the department a copy of the certificate of occupancy (certificate) issued for the private school building by the municipality within which the private school is located.  If the municipality does not issue certificates, the private school may submit either a certificate issued by a local or regional governmental unit with authority to issue such a certificate or a letter or form from the municipality that explains that the municipality does not issue certificates.\n\nThis bill requires a private school located in a municipality that does not issue certificates to annually obtain a building inspection of the school building.\n\nMiscellaneous other provisions\n\nUnder current law, the department may only release data related to enrollment of, standardized test results for, and other information related to pupils participating in a parental choice program all at the same time, uniformly, and completely.  This bill eliminates this requirement.\n\nThis bill requires a private school participating in a parental choice program to permit public inspection and copying of any record of the private school that relates to pupils attending the private school under the program to the same extent as required of, and subject to the same terms and enforcement provisions that apply to, a school board.  The bill authorizes the department to issue an order barring the private school from participating in the parental choice program for the current school year if the private school violates this requirement.\n\nThis bill requires that a private school be located in this state in order to participate in a parental choice program.\n\nThis bill provides that a private school may participate in a parental choice program only if it has been in operation for the attendance of pupils for at least two school years.  The bill also provides that no more than 49 percent of a private school's enrollment may consist of pupils attending the private school under a parental choice program.\n\nCurrently, a private school participating in a parental choice program must schedule two meetings each year at which members of the school's governing board will be present and at which pupils and prospective pupils and their parents may meet and communicate with the members of the governing board.\n\nThis bill requires a private school participating in a parental choice program to hold at least one such meeting each month.  The bill requires that the meetings be open to the public and that the private school provide public notice of the meetings in the same manner as notice of meetings of governmental bodies is required to be provided.  Finally, the bill authorizes the department to issue an order barring the private school from participating in the parental choice program for the current school year if the private school violates these requirements.\n\n\nFor further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\n            Down\r\n        Down\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Up\r\n        Up\r\nAB854,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  20.255 (1) (f) of the statutes, as affected by 2015 Wisconsin Act 55, 2is amended to read:\nAB854,7,23\n20.255 (1) (f)  Assessments of reading readiness.

Referred to Committee on State Affairs and Government Operations.\n\nAB855,1,5\n1An Act to amend 49.45 (23) (a) and 49.471 (4) (a) 4. b.; and to create 49.471 (1) 2(cr), 49.471 (4g), 118.60 (10m), 119.23 (10m) and 946.94 of the statutes; 3relating to: fraud in parental choice programs, Medicaid expansion, eligibility 4for BadgerCare Plus and BadgerCare Plus Core, and providing a criminal 5penalty.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nThis bill subjects certain acts and omissions related to a Parental Choice Program (PCP) to criminal penalties and changes the family income eligibility level to up to 133 percent of the federal poverty line (FPL) for parents and caretaker relatives under BadgerCare Plus (BC+) and for childless adults under BadgerCare Plus Core (BC+ Core).\n\nUnder the bill, intentionally making a false statement or representation in an application to participate in a PCP is a Class A misdemeanor.  The bill makes concealing or failing to disclose an event with an intent to fraudulently participate in a PCP or using a payment received under a PCP for an unauthorized purpose either a Class G or Class H felony, depending on the payment a person received under the PCP.  Additionally, under the bill, a statement in a written application for a PCP is considered to be an admission of the existence, correctness, or validity of the statement.  This bill authorizes the Department of Justice or a district attorney to prosecute violations of criminal laws affecting a PCP, including laws affecting the health, safety, and welfare of pupils attending a private school participating in a PCP.\n\nCurrently, the Department of Health Services (DHS) administers the Medical Assistance (MA) program, which is a joint federal and state program that provides health services to individuals who have limited financial resources.  Some services are provided through programs that operate under a waiver of federal Medicaid laws, including services provided through the BC+ and BC+ Core programs.  Certain parents and caretaker relatives with incomes of not more than 100 percent of the FPL, before a 5 percent income disregard is applied, are eligible for BC+ benefits.  Adults who are under age 65, who have family incomes that do not exceed 100 percent of the FPL, before a 5 percent income disregard is applied, and who are not otherwise eligible for MA, including BC+ (childless adults), are eligible for benefits under BC+ Core.\n\nThe federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act allows a state to receive an enhanced federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) payment for providing benefits to certain individuals through a state's MA program.  The bill expands the income eligibility level for parents and caretaker relatives under BC+ and for childless adults under BC+ Core.  The bill requires DHS to comply with all federal requirements and to submit any amendment to the state MA plan, request for a waiver of Medicaid law, or other federal approval necessary to qualify for the highest available enhanced FMAP for parents and caretaker relatives and childless adults eligible for BC+ Core (collectively nonpregnant, nonelderly adults).  If DHS does not qualify for the enhanced FMAP or if the FMAP is reduced, DHS is required to submit to the Joint Committee on Finance (JCF) a fiscal analysis comparing the cost of covering nonpregnant, nonelderly adults under the MA program at up to 133 percent of the FPL to the cost of limiting income eligibility to those adults to up to 100 percent of the FPL.  DHS may reduce income eligibility levels for nonpregnant, nonelderly adults to up to 100 percent of the FPL only if JCF approves.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB855,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  49.45 (23) (a) of the statutes is amended to read:\nAB855,3,22\n49.45 (23) (a)  The department shall request a waiver from the secretary of the 3federal department of health and human services to permit the department to 4conduct a demonstration project to provide health care coverage to adults who are 5under the age of 65, who have family incomes not to exceed 100 133 percent of the 6poverty line before application of the 5 percent income disregard under 42 CFR 7435.603 (d), except as provided in s. 49.471 (4g), and who are not otherwise eligible 1for medical assistance under this subchapter, the Badger Care health care program 2under s. 49.665, or Medicare under 42 USC 1395 et seq.AB855,2\n\n\n3Section \n2.  49.471 (1) (cr) of the statutes is created to read:\nAB855,3,54\n49.471 (1) (cr)  \"Enhanced federal medical assistance percentage\" means a 5federal medical assistance percentage described under 42 USC 1396d (y) or (z).AB855,3\n\n\n6Section \n3.  49.471 (4) (a) 4. b. of the statutes is amended to read:\nAB855,3,97\n49.471 (4) (a) 4. b.

Ott, Petryk, Quinn, Rohrkaste, Tauchen, Tittl, Tranel, VanderMeer and Knudson, cosponsored by Senators Marklein, \nCowles, Lasee, Lassa, Petrowski, Roth, Vukmir and Olsen. Referred to Joint Committee on Finance.\n\nAB856,1,5\n1An Act to renumber and amend 46.2895 (2); to amend 46.2895 (3) (b) 5. and 246.2895 (13); and to create 46.284 (2) (br), 46.284 (4m), 46.2895 (2) (b), 46.2895 3(2) (c), 46.2895 (3) (e), 46.2895 (4) (o), 46.2895 (4) (p), 46.2895 (4) (q), 46.2895 4(4) (r), 46.2895 (4r) and 46.2895 (6) (cm) of the statutes; relating to: long-term 5care districts and care management organizations.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nThis bill allows the Department of Health Services to contract with a county or long-term care district to operate a care management organization outside the geographic area of that county or long-term care district and specifies a different disposition of property and assets upon dissolution of a long-term care district.  The bill also allows a long-term care district or a governmental entity that has a contract to operate a care management organization to create a nonstock, nonprofit corporation or a service insurance corporation and to assign certain contracts, permits, and certifications to the corporation with approval of DHS and the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance.\n\nCurrently, a care management organization, under a contract with DHS, enrolls individuals in the Family Care program and administers the Family Care benefit, which provides financial assistance for long-term care to a frail elder or a person with a physical or developmental disability.  DHS may contract with a county, a long-term care district, a governing body of a tribe or band or the Great Lakes Inter-Tribal Council, a joint association of those entities, or a private organization to be a care management organization.  A county, tribe or band, or a combination of counties or tribes or bands may create a long-term care district, which is a special purpose district that is a local unit of government.  Currently, the jurisdiction of a long-term care district is the geographic area of the county or counties that created the district or the geographic area of the reservation of, or land held in trust for, any tribe or band that created the district.  This bill allows DHS to contract with a county or long-term care district to operate a care management organization outside the geographic area of that county or long-term care district.  The bill specifies that DHS may award contracts to one or more certified entities to operate a care management organization within a county or geographic area.  If DHS awards a contract to a long-term care district to operate a care management organization outside the geographic area of the counties that created the long-term care district, the bill allows any county that is newly served by that care management organization to join the existing long-term care district under certain circumstances at the discretion of the long-term care district's board.  The bill also specifies that upon dissolution of a long-term care district the property and the assets of the corporation transfer to DHS instead of the entity that created the long-term care district.\n\nThe bill also allows a long-term care district or a governmental entity that has a contract to operate a care management organization to create a nonstock, nonprofit corporation or a service insurance corporation.  Before creating the corporation that provides the Family Care benefit, the long-term care district or governmental entity must submit the proposed articles of incorporation to DHS for review and approval.  With approval of DHS and OCI, the long-term care district or governmental entity may then assign to the corporation the district's assets and liabilities, a contract with DHS to operate a care management organization, a permit issued by OCI to operate as a care management organization, or a care management organization certification by DHS.  DHS must then notify enrollees of the transfer of the contract to the corporation and inform enrollees of their rights and responsibilities in accordance with any federal requirements.\n\nThe 2015-17 budget act specifies that the Family Care program will be expanded statewide and requires DHS to request a waiver to make certain changes to the long-term care program, including the creation of integrated health agencies.  DHS must include in its waiver request provisions to allow a long-term care district to operate an integrated health agency, including operating an integrated health agency outside its geographic area.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB856,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  46.284 (2) (br) of the statutes is created to read:\nAB856,3,3\n146.284 (2) (br) 1.

Under the law, DATCP inspectors may enter any property at any reasonable time for purposes of inspection, investigation, and control of suspected pest infestations; may stop any person or vehicle believed to be carrying plants or other materials infested with pests; and may seize and destroy infested plants and other materials transported in violation of any law, rule, or quarantine.\n\nUnder this bill, before a DATCP inspector may enter property other than agricultural lands or agricultural business premises for purposes of inspection, investigation, or control of a suspected pest infestation, DATCP must request the permission of the owner of the property.  If the owner does not give permission, DATCP may not proceed without an inspection warrant.\n\nUnder current law, DATCP may also order the owner of property where a pest infestation occurs to treat the property or treat or destroy infested plants or other material.  The owner may appeal the order within ten days.  If the owner fails to comply with the order within ten days, DATCP may treat the property or treat or destroy the infested plants or other material and charge the owner for the work.\n\nUnder this bill, before DATCP may order the owner of property where a pest infestation occurs, other than agricultural lands or agricultural business premises, to treat the property or treat or destroy infested plants or other material, DATCP must first ask the owner to do so.  If the owner does not agree, DATCP may issue an order.  The owner has 30 days to appeal the order and, if the owner appeals, DATCP may not treat the premises or treat or destroy the infested plants or other material while the appeal is pending.\n\nFor further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB857,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  94.01 (4) of the statutes is amended to read:\nAB857,2,92\n94.01 (4)  The Subject to sub.

If the person 1does not grant permission or cannot be located, the department may not enter the 2property without an inspection warrant under s. 66.0119.\nAB857,3\n\n\n3Section \n3.  94.02 (1) of the statutes is amended to read:\nAB857,3,154\n94.02 (1)  If the department finds any agricultural lands or agricultural 5business premises, or any plants, plant parts, or pest-harboring materials located 6thereon are so infested or infected with injurious pests as to constitute a hazard to 7plant or animal life in the state, or any area thereof, it may notify the owner or person 8having charge of such premises to that effect, and the owner or person in charge shall, 9within 10 days after such notice, cause the treatment of the premises or the 10treatment or removal and destruction of infested or infected plants, host plants or 11other pest-harboring material as directed in the notice.  No person may violate the 12terms of any notice received under this subsection, nor may any damages be awarded 13to the owner for such treatment, removal or destruction.  Any person affected by a 14notice or order may appeal to the department and request a hearing under s. 94.01 15(2).\nAB857,4\n\n\n16Section \n4.  94.02 (2) of the statutes is amended to read:\nAB857,3,2517\n94.02 (2)  If the owner or person in charge fails to comply with the terms of the 18a notice under sub.

Referred to Committee on State Affairs and Government Operations.\n\nAB861,1,8\n1An Act to repeal 59.692 (1) (e), 59.692 (1d), 59.692 (1f), 59.692 (1k) and 59.692 2(5m); to renumber 59.692 (1c); to amend 49.45 (23) (a), 49.471 (4) (a) 4. b., 359.692 (1) (bn), 59.692 (4) (b), 61.353 (3) (intro.) and 62.233 (3) (intro.); to 4repeal and recreate 59.692 (2m) and 281.31 (2m); and to create 49.471 (1) 5(cr), 49.471 (4g), 59.692 (1t), 61.353 (3) (cm), 61.353 (3) (dm), 62.233 (3) (cm) and 662.233 (3) (dm) of the statutes; relating to: standards and ordinances 7regulating shoreland zoning, Medicaid expansion, and eligibility for 8BadgerCare Plus and BadgerCare Plus Core.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nThis bill eliminates the changes to the laws regulating shoreland zoning that were made under the 2015-17 biennial budget act, 2015 Wisconsin Act 55 (Act 55).\nCurrent law requires a county to enact shoreland zoning ordinances for all shorelands in its unincorporated area and requires those ordinances to meet shoreland zoning standards established by the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) by rule.  Current law generally defines a shoreland to be an area within a specified distance from the edge of a navigable water.\n\nAct 55 made various changes to the laws regulating shoreland zoning including the following:\n\n1.  Prohibiting a county shoreland zoning ordinance from regulating a matter more restrictively than the matter is regulated by a shoreland zoning standard promulgated by DNR.\n\n2.  Prohibiting a shoreland zoning ordinance from requiring a person to establish a vegetative buffer zone on previously developed land or expand an existing buffer zone.\n\n3.  Requiring a shoreland zoning ordinance to allow a vegetative buffer zone to contain a viewing corridor of at least 35 feet wide for every 100 feet of shoreline frontage and to allow the corridor to run contiguously for the entire maximum allowable width.\n\n4.  Prohibiting DNR from establishing shoreland zoning standards and prohibiting counties from enacting shoreland zoning ordinances that regulate certain outdoor lighting, that regulate certain construction activities with respect to nonconforming structures, and that impose certain standards for impervious surfaces.\n\n5.  Allowing certain maintenance and repair of nonconforming structures in shorelands that are accessory structures such as garages, sheds, sidewalks, and patios.\n\n6.  Generally requiring city and village shoreland zoning ordinances that apply to certain shorelands that were annexed or incorporated by the city or village to be consistent with the requirements and limitations applicable to county shoreland zoning ordinances.\n\n7.  Prohibits DNR from appealing a decision of a county to grant or deny a variance to a law regulating county shoreland zoning.\n\nThis bill eliminates the changes to the law made by Act 55 so that the law is consistent with pre-Act 55 law.\n\nThis bill changes the family income eligibility level to up to 133 percent of the federal poverty line (FPL) for parents and caretaker relatives under BadgerCare Plus (BC+) and for childless adults under BadgerCare Plus Core (BC+ Core).  Currently, the Department of Health Services (DHS) administers the Medical Assistance (MA) program, which is a joint federal and state program that provides health services to individuals who have limited financial resources.  Some services are provided through programs that operate under a waiver of federal Medicaid laws, including services provided through the BC+ and BC+ Core programs.\n\nUnder current law, certain parents and caretaker relatives with incomes of not more than 100 percent of the FPL, before a 5 percent income disregard is applied, are eligible for BC+ benefits.  Under current law, adults who are under age 65, who have family incomes that do not exceed 100 percent of the FPL, before a 5 percent income disregard is applied, and who are not otherwise eligible for MA, including BC+ (childless adults), are eligible for benefits under BC+ Core.\n\nThe federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act allows a state to receive an enhanced federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) payment for providing benefits to certain individuals through a state's MA program.  The bill expands the income eligibility level for parents and caretaker relatives under BC+ and for childless adults under BC+ Core.  The bill requires DHS to comply with all federal requirements and to request any amendment to the state MA plan, waiver of Medicaid law, or other federal approval necessary to qualify for the highest available enhanced FMAP for parents and caretaker relatives and childless adults eligible for BC+ Core (collectively nonpregnant, nonelderly adults).  If DHS does not qualify for the enhanced FMAP or if the FMAP is reduced, DHS is required to submit to the Joint Committee on Finance (JCF) a fiscal analysis comparing the cost of covering nonpregnant, nonelderly adults under the MA program at up to 133 percent of the FPL to the cost of limiting income eligibility to those adults to up to 100 percent of the FPL.  DHS may reduce income eligibility levels for nonpregnant, nonelderly adults to up to 100 percent of the FPL only if JCF approves.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB861,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  49.45 (23) (a) of the statutes is amended to read:\nAB861,3,92\n49.45 (23) (a)  The department shall request a waiver from the secretary of the 3federal department of health and human services to permit the department to 4conduct a demonstration project to provide health care coverage to adults who are 5under the age of 65, who have family incomes not to exceed 100 133 percent of the 6poverty line before application of the 5 percent income disregard under 42 CFR 7435.603 (d), except as provided in s. 49.471 (4g), and who are not otherwise eligible 8for medical assistance under this subchapter, the Badger Care health care program 9under s. 49.665, or Medicare under 42 USC 1395 et seq.AB861,2\n\n\n10Section \n2.  49.471 (1) (cr) of the statutes is created to read:\nAB861,3,1211\n49.471 (1) (cr)  \"Enhanced federal medical assistance percentage\" means a 12federal medical assistance percentage described under 42 USC 1396d (y) or (z).AB861,3\n\n\n13Section \n3.  49.471 (4) (a) 4. b. of the statutes is amended to read:\nAB861,4,3\n149.471 (4) (a) 4. b.

Under current law, if a verdict is entered in favor of the plaintiff in such an action and the defendant is found to be 51 percent or more causally negligent or responsible for the plaintiff's entire damages under Wisconsin's contributory negligence law, the plaintiff may not collect any amount of damages until after the plaintiff assigns to the defendant all pending, current, and future rights or claims he or she has or may have for a personal injury claim against an asbestos trust.  Current law also provides that, if a verdict is entered in favor of the plaintiff in such an action and the defendant is found to be less than 51 percent causally negligent or responsible for the plaintiff's entire damages, the plaintiff may not collect any amount of damages until after the plaintiff assigns to the defendant all future rights or claims he or she has or may have for a personal injury claim against an asbestos trust.\n\nThis bill repeals these provisions concerning damages and the assignment of claims and instead provides the following:\n\n1) A defendant in a personal injury action involving asbestos exposure that is not an asbestos trust and that is found to be causally negligent is jointly and severally liable for the damages allowed.\n\n2) A defendant described under item 1 may request a postjudgment hearing to determine the total amount of payment received by the plaintiff, before the judgment was entered against that defendant, from one or more asbestos trusts.  Such a defendant may receive a dollar-for-dollar credit for any such payment received by the plaintiff.\n\n3) A defendant described under item 1 may request a postjudgment hearing to determine whether the plaintiff had any unpaid claims pending against one or more asbestos trusts.  If the court finds any such unpaid claims, the court may order the plaintiff to assign to the defendant his or her unpaid claims only if the plaintiff will be made whole by the judgment.\n\n4) If a court orders an assignment under item 3, the plaintiff must work with the defendant to obtain amounts due from each asbestos trust pursuant to the trust's governance documents.\n\n5) If the court orders an assignment under item 3, each claim the defendant files pursuant to the assignment is to be treated as if the plaintiff submitted the claim.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB862,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  802.025 (6) of the statutes is repealed and recreated to read:\nAB862,2,42\n802.025 (6)  Damages.

Once a TID has been created, the Department of Revenue (DOR) calculates the \"tax incremental base\" value of the TID, which is the equalized value of all taxable property within the TID at the time of its creation.  If the development in the TID increases the value of the property in the TID above the base value, a \"value increment\" is created.  That portion of the property taxes collected from the TID that is attributable to the value increment is called a \"tax increment.\"  The tax increment is placed in a special fund that may be used only to pay back the project costs of the TID.  The project costs of a TID, which are initially incurred by the creating city or village, include public works such as sewers, streets, and lighting systems; financing costs; site preparation costs; and professional service costs.\n\nDOR authorizes the allocation of the tax increments until the TID terminates or, generally, 20 years, 23 years, or 27 years after the TID is created, depending on the type of TID and the year in which it was created.  Also under current law, a city or village may not generally make expenditures for project costs later than five years before the unextended termination date of the TID.  Under certain circumstances, the life of the TID, the expenditure period, and the allocation period may be extended.\n\nUnder this bill, with regard to Tax Incremental District Number 3 in the city of Middleton, the expenditures for project costs may be made for up to 42 years after the TID was created, the Department of Revenue may allocate tax increments for up to 47 years after the TID's creation, and the maximum life of the TID is extended for ten years.\n\nFor further information see the local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB863,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  66.1105 (6) (a) 10. of the statutes is amended to read:\nAB863,2,42\n66.1105 (6) (a) 10.

Current law also prohibits an adult from intentionally encouraging or contributing to an underage alcohol violation and from knowingly permitting or failing to take action to prevent the illegal consumption of alcohol beverages by an underage person on premises owned by the adult or under the adult's control.  If a retail licensee violates any of these prohibitions, a court must suspend the retail license if the retail licensee committed a prior violation within the previous 12 months.  For any person, other than a retail licensee, who violates any of these prohibitions, the person may be required to forfeit not more than $500 if the person has no prior violations within the previous 30 months; however, if the person has prior violations within this time period, the person is subject to various criminal penalties.  In addition, if the person holds a bartender's license, the court must suspend the bartender's license if there is any prior violation within the previous 12 months.  Only one penalty may be imposed for each underage person who is unlawfully provided alcohol beverages, so if alcohol beverages are provided on licensed premises by a bartender who is not the retail licensee, the bartender and the retail licensee cannot both be subject to a penalty for the violation.\n\nUnder this bill, if a violation of any of the prohibitions described above occurs on licensed premises and the violation is detected by means of an undercover underage person employed by or assisting a law enforcement agency, only the individual responsible for providing the alcohol beverages to the underage person may be issued a citation for, or charged with, the violation.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB864,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  125.07 (1) (b) 6. of the statutes is renumbered 125.07 (1) (b) 6. b. and 2amended to read:\nAB864,2,53\n125.07 (1) (b) 6. b.

Additionally, a pharmacy student may only administer such a prescribed drug product or device under the direct supervision of a pharmacist who has also successfully completed a training course.\n\nThis bill eliminates the limitation providing that a pharmacist or pharmacy student may administer such a prescribed drug product or device only in the course of teaching self-administration techniques to a patient.  However, the bill requires a pharmacist or pharmacy student, or his or her agent after the pharmacist or pharmacy student administers a prescribed drug product or device to a patient, to notify the prescribing practitioner or enter the information in a patient record system shared by the prescribing practitioner.\n\nFor further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB865,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  450.02 (2g) (b) of the statutes, as affected by 2015 Wisconsin Act 55, 2is amended to read:\nAB865,2,63\n450.02 (2g) (b)  The board shall promulgate rules that establish requirements 4and procedures for the administration of a drug product or device, as defined in s. 5450.035 (1g), by a pharmacist under s. 450.035 (1r) or by another person under s. 6450.035 (1t).\nAB865,2\n\n\n7Section \n2.  450.035 (1r) of the statutes is amended to read:\nAB865,2,198\n450.035 (1r)  A pharmacist may not administer by injection a prescribed drug 9product or device unless he or she has successfully completed a course of study and 10training in injection administration technique conducted by a course provider 11approved by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education or the board.

This bill deletes this provision and instead provides that a pharmacist may exercise his or her professional judgment to dispense varying quantities of the prescribed drug per fill up to the total number of dosage units as authorized by the prescriber in the original prescription including any refills, unless the prescriber has specified in the prescription order that dispensing a prescribed drug in an initial amount followed by periodic refills as specified in the prescription order is medically necessary.

Current law provides for the election of coroners for four-year terms by the electors of each county or of more than one county in certain cases, except that a county with a population of 500,000 or more must, and a county with a population of less than 500,000 may, abolish the office of coroner and establish a medical examiner system.  Under the medical examiner system, a medical examiner is appointed by the county board or, in populous counties, by the county executive.  Current law does not otherwise specify any particular requirements that an individual must fulfill in order to hold the office of coroner or to be appointed as a medical examiner.\n\nLicensure of medical examiners, medicolegal investigators, and others\n\nThe bill establishes a prohibition against performing a death investigation or performing the functions of a medical examiner or a person who assists a coroner or medical examiner with a death investigation (medicolegal investigation staff member) without a license in medicolegal investigation issued by the Medicolegal Investigation Examining Board, except that the bill exempts coroners and certain accredited medical examiners from this requirement.  Any person who violates the prohibition may be subject to a fine of not more than $1,000 and imprisonment of up to 90 days.\n\nThe bill requires the board to issue an initial license in medicolegal investigation, at no charge, to every individual who is serving as a nonaccredited medical examiner or medicolegal investigation staff member in this state on the bill's effective date.  The bill also allows an individual who is serving as coroner on the bill's effective date to elect to receive such a license.  The bill requires each such individual to complete, prior to the next license renewal date, 40 hours of education, except that the bill allows an individual who holds a credential, in good standing, from a nationally recognized accreditation organization specializing in death investigation education to receive a waiver from completing 16 of those 40 hours.  The bill requires the board to provide, at no cost, the required hours of training to these individuals.\n\nThe bill also requires the board to issue a license in medicolegal investigation to any individual who is appointed as a nonaccredited medical examiner or is hired to serve as a medicolegal investigation staff member after the bill's effective date, if the individual pays any initial license fee imposed by the board.  The bill requires such an individual to complete a 40-hour death investigation training course within 18 months of initial licensure.\n\nFinally, the bill allows an individual who is not serving as a medical examiner or medicolegal investigator to obtain a license in medicolegal investigation from the board if he or she first completes 40 hours of training and pays any licensure fee established by the board.\n\nThe bill provides that the renewal date for any license in medicolegal investigation is January 1, 2019, and every four years thereafter.  In order to renew a license, a license holder must pay any renewal fee imposed by the board and complete 24 hours of education, subject to certain exemptions for initial renewals.\n\nMedicolegal Investigation Examining Board; powers and duties\n\nThe bill provides for the creation of the 11-member board in the Department of Safety and Professional Services, to be composed of two individuals who are coroners, chief deputy coroners, or deputy coroners; two individuals who are nonaccredited medical examiners or medicolegal investigation staff members; two accredited medical examiners; a member of the Wisconsin District Attorneys' Association; members of two specified law enforcement organizations; the attorney general or his or her designee; and one public member, appointed for six-year terms.  The bill requires the board to do all of the following:\n\n1.  Promulgate rules specifying standards and curricula for training and education requirements for individuals holding a license in medicolegal investigation issued by the board.\n\n2.  Coordinate and provide, on a regional basis, training and education for holders of licenses issued by the board at no cost to those license holders.\n\n3.  Monitor compliance with the licensure requirements created by the bill.\n\n4.  Revoke the license of a license holder who fails to complete the required death investigation course.\n\n5.  Provide the required training and education to license holders.  The bill allows the board to impose fees for licenses issued after the bill's effective date and for license renewals.\n\nThe bill also requires the board, if a license is revoked or not renewed for any reason, to do any of the following that applies to the license holder:\n\n1.  If the license holder is a nonaccredited medical examiner, send a statement to the county board or county executive, if applicable, for any county in which the license holder serves, recommending dismissal of the nonaccredited medical examiner because of the revocation or failure to renew the license.\n\n2.  If the license holder is a medicolegal investigation staff member, send a notice to the office in which the individual works notifying the coroner or medical examiner of the revocation or failure to renew the license.\n\nThe bill requires an individual who is appointed as a nonaccredited medical examiner or is hired to serve as a medicolegal investigation staff member, and who leaves his or her position as a medical examiner or medicolegal investigation staff member, to so inform the board.\n\nThe bill appropriates to the board all moneys received from licensure fees for medicolegal investigators licensed by the board and moneys received by the Department of Health Services for the issuance of death certificates.\n\nReporting deaths\n\nUnder current law, any person who has knowledge of certain deaths must report the death to the sheriff, police chief, or medical examiner or coroner for the locality in which the death occurred.  The following types of deaths must be reported: a death that involves unexplained, unusual, or suspicious circumstances; a homicide or suicide; a death following an accident; a death that is due to poisoning; a death following an abortion; a death for which a physician or spiritual advisor did not attend the deceased within 30 days before death; and a death for which a physician refuses to sign the death certificate or for which a physician cannot timely be obtained to sign the medical certification that is required for a death certificate.  A sheriff or police chief who is notified of such a death must notify the coroner or medical examiner of the death, and the coroner or medical examiner must notify the district attorney.  In addition, current law requires a parent, stepparent, guardian, or legal custodian of a child to report to law enforcement the death of the child if it occurs under certain circumstances.\n\nThe bill requires that a law enforcement officer, health care provider, or funeral director who has knowledge of a death that occurs outside a hospital, nursing home, hospice, or physician's office must immediately report the death to the appropriate law enforcement agency and the coroner or medical examiner in the county where the death occurred or where the body or remains were located.  Any person who discovers a body or the remains of a deceased individual outside a hospital, nursing home, hospice, or physician's office must also immediately report the death, if the death is of a type that must be reported, to law enforcement in the county where the death occurred or where the body or remains were located and may also report the death to the coroner or medical examiner.  If the discovery of the body or remains is not reported to the coroner or medical examiner, law enforcement must report the discovery to the coroner or medical examiner.  The bill also includes specific reporting requirements for deaths that occur in hospitals, nursing homes, hospices, or physician's offices.  First, a health care provider must report each death that occurs in a physician's office.  Second, a hospice must report deaths that occur while a person is receiving care from hospice in accordance with the coroner or medical examiner's written policy.  Third, a hospital or nursing home must report each death that occurs at the hospital or nursing home and that did not result from a natural disease process.  Fourth, a hospital must report each death that occurs in the emergency department of the hospital.\n\nCurrently, the penalty for failure to report a death for which reporting is required is a fine not to exceed $1,000 or imprisonment for not more than 90 days.  The bill increases the maximum fine to $10,000 for a partnership, association, organization, institution, or body politic or corporate that fails to report a death for which reporting is required.\n\nJurisdiction to investigate death and notifications\n\nThe bill assigns jurisdiction to investigate the cause and manner of a death to the coroner or medical examiner in the county in which occurred the crime, injury, or other event that caused the death.  However, if it cannot be determined where the event that caused the death occurred, or if the death occurred outside the state, the coroner or medical examiner in the county in which death was pronounced has jurisdiction to investigate.  The bill provides that after any crime scene investigation the coroner or medical examiner who has jurisdiction to investigate cause and manner of death has custody of the deceased's body and prohibits any person from moving the body at or from a death scene without authorization from the law enforcement agency investigating the death and the coroner or medical examiner.  The bill requires a coroner or medical examiner who receives notice of a death to notify the deceased's next of kin.  The bill provides that a coroner or medical examiner need not notify the district attorney of certain types of reported deaths if the district attorney has waived notice in writing.\n\nAutopsies and other diagnostic procedures\n\nCurrently, a coroner, medical examiner, or district attorney may order an autopsy conducted on a body if there is reason to believe that the death resulted from a homicide or certain other crimes or suicide, or occurred under unexplained or suspicious circumstances.  A coroner or medical examiner must order an autopsy on any person who dies while confined in a correctional facility in this state.  If a child who is under two years of age dies unexpectedly or under circumstances indicating sudden infant death syndrome, the coroner or medical examiner must order an autopsy unless the parent or guardian requests in writing that an autopsy not be performed.  If the autopsy reveals that sudden infant death syndrome is the cause of death, that cause shall be stated in the autopsy report.  No person may perform an autopsy on the body of a person whose death must be reported without obtaining written authorization from the coroner or medical examiner.\n\nUnder current law, if an autopsy is not performed in connection with a death that must be reported, the coroner or medical examiner may take specimens from the body for analysis to assist in determining the cause of death.  The coroner or medical examiner must take specimens for analysis in such cases if requested to do so by the spouse, parent, child, or sibling of the deceased.\n\nThe bill requires a coroner or medical examiner to order an autopsy for the following deaths:  a death that likely resulted from a crime; a death of a person under two years of age under circumstances indicating sudden infant death syndrome; a death of a person under 18 years of age that is unusual or unexplained; a death of a person who is in the custody of a law enforcement officer or under active pursuit by a law enforcement officer, or that otherwise involves a law enforcement officer; a death of a person who is confined in federal prison or confined in a jail or otherwise confined by a sheriff; and a death of a person who is detained or institutionalized in connection with a civil commitment, preliminary proceedings for civil commitment, or criminal trial competency proceedings.  The bill allows a district attorney to order an autopsy.  The bill repeals the requirement that a coroner or medical examiner, in cases where a death must be reported, must take specimens from a deceased's body upon request of the deceased's spouse, parent, child, or sibling.  Under the bill, if a coroner or medical examiner does not order an autopsy for a death that must be reported and a representative of the deceased inquires about performance of an autopsy, the coroner or medical examiner must inform the representative that the representative may independently contract for pathology-related services.  Finally, the bill repeals the requirement that, when applicable, coroners and medical examiners cite sudden infant death syndrome as the cause of death in an autopsy report.\n\nInvestigation records and handling of personal property\n\nThe bill requires that each coroner or medical examiner keep records of each death investigation and specifies the contents of the records.  The bill further requires that the coroner or medical examiner keep death investigation records in an office that is owned or leased by the county and designated as the office of the coroner or medical examiner.\n\nThe bill provides that records of autopsies and other diagnostic procedures are confidential.  Under the bill, a coroner or medical examiner may release such records only to persons who have authority to access the deceased's health care records without informed consent, to a representative of the deceased, or for educational purposes.  The bill requires that a coroner or medical examiner keep all confidential records that are gathered for an investigation, such as health care records, confidential with certain exceptions.  At the request of a law enforcement agency investigating a death, a coroner or medical examiner must keep death investigation records and information related to an investigation confidential during the course of the investigation.  The bill also requires that each coroner or medical examiner maintain written policies regarding access to death investigation records.\n\nThe bill requires a coroner or medical examiner to maintain an inventory of personal property that the coroner or medical examiner takes from a death scene or from a deceased.  The bill specifies that the coroner or medical examiner must destroy, in accordance with applicable county evidence retention policies and standards for disposal of medications, or donate to a drug repository program any prescription medications that the coroner or medical examiner collects in an investigation and does not provide to a law enforcement agency.\n\nDisposition of bodies\n\nUnder current law, the coroner's or medical examiner's authorization is required for various activities related to the disposition of bodies.\n\nAuthorization to embalm or dispose of a body.  Under current law, a coroner's or medical examiner's authorization is required to embalm or perform an autopsy on the body of a person whose death must be reported.  A coroner or medical examiner must issue the authorization within 12 hours of receiving notice of the death or as soon thereafter as possible in the event of unexplained, unusual, or suspicious circumstances.\n\nThe bill requires an authorization from the coroner or medical examiner to embalm, bury, entomb, cremate, or deliver for research purposes the body of a person whose death must be reported.  The bill specifies certain information that a coroner or medical examiner must include on an authorization to embalm or dispose of a body, eliminates the general 12-hour deadline for issuing an authorization to embalm, and provides that a coroner or medical examiner must issue an authorization to embalm or dispose of a body as soon as possible after being notified of a death.\n\nCremation permit.  Under current law, a cremation permit issued by a coroner or medical examiner is required for cremation of the body of any deceased person.  Currently, a person may not cremate a body within 48 hours of death, or discovery of death, unless the death was caused by a contagious or infectious disease.  A coroner or medical examiner must view a body and make inquiry into the cause and manner of death before issuing a cremation permit.  Finally, a cremation permit for the body of a person who died outside the state may be used only in the county in which it is issued.\n\nThe bill calls the authorization required for cremation a release rather than a permit.  The bill provides that even when a death is caused by a contagious or infectious disease, the body may not be cremated within 48 hours of the pronouncement of death unless the body must be cremated immediately to effectively contain the disease or a public health authority orders the sooner disposal of the body during a state of emergency that is related to public health.  The bill requires that, if the medical certification of the cause and manner of death on a death certificate is completed by a physician, the coroner or medical examiner must review the medical certification before issuing a cremation release.  The bill further requires that a coroner or medical examiner must specify on a cremation release the earliest date and time that cremation may occur.  Finally, the bill requires that a person who receives a body for medical research or education must request a cremation release before receiving the body.\n\nAuthorization to disinter and reinter.  Under current law, a coroner or medical examiner must issue an authorization to disinter and reinter a body upon an order of the court or at the request of various next of kin of the deceased or another person who has authority to dispose of the body.\n\nThe bill clarifies that no person, other than a cemetery, may disinter a body or human remains without authorization from the coroner or medical examiner.  The bill adds, as a condition for obtaining a coroner's or medical examiner's authorization for disinterment without a court order, that the person requesting authorization provide proof of intent to cremate or bury the disinterred remains.\n\nDisposition of unidentified or unclaimed bodies.  Under current law, if an inmate of a state, county, or municipal institution dies, and a relative or friend of the deceased does not claim the body and a medical or mortuary school does not take the body, the superintendent of the institution must bury the body.\n\nThis bill provides that, if a person other than the superintendent of a state, county, or municipal institution has an unidentified or unclaimed body, the person shall notify the coroner or medical examiner in the county of residence of the deceased, who must bury or cremate the body.  The bill further provides that, if the coroner or medical examiner makes reasonable efforts to identify a body and notify the deceased's representative of disposal of the body, the coroner or medical examiner is immune from civil liability for his or her choice of method for disposing of the body.\n            Down\r\n        Down\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Up\r\n        Up\r\n\nMental health treatment records\n\nUnder current law, a coroner or medical examiner may obtain a deceased's health care records without informed consent for the purpose of completing a medical certification on a certificate of death or for conducting a death investigation.  This bill provides a coroner or medical examiner access to a deceased's mental health treatment records without informed consent for the purpose of completing a medical certification on a certificate of death or for conducting a death investigation.\n\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB867,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  15.405 (18) of the statutes is created to read:\nAB867,8,52\n15.405 (18)  Medicolegal investigation examining board.

Taylor and Zepnick, cosponsored by Senators Vinehout, Ringhand, Carpenter and L. Taylor. Referred to Committee on Education.\n\nAB878,1,3\n1An Act to create 20.235 (1) (fr) and 39.387 of the statutes; relating to: creation 2of a grant program for teachers employed by sparsely populated school districts 3and granting rule-making authority.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nUnder current law, the Higher Educational Aids Board (HEAB) administers various financial assistance programs to assist teachers.  Those programs include programs under which HEAB provides loans to college students and then forgives a certain amount of those loans after the loan recipient has been employed as a teacher in the Milwaukee Public Schools, as a teacher of visually impaired pupils or as an orientation and mobility instructor in this state, or as a teacher in a school district in this state in which minority students constitute at least 29 percent of the membership of the school district.\n\nThis bill creates a rural teacher grant program (grant program), to be administered by HEAB, to encourage eligible teachers, as defined in the bill, to teach in schools operated by eligible school districts, as defined in the bill.  Under the bill, 1) an \"eligible school district\" is a school district whose membership in the school year preceding the school year for which a grant is awarded under the grant program divided by the school district's area in square miles is less than ten; and 2) an \"eligible teacher\" is a teacher who teaches in a school operated by an eligible school district.\n\nThe bill requires HEAB to grant financial assistance to an eligible teacher who is nominated by his or her school district for participation in the grant program and who submits a claim for that financial assistance after each year in which the eligible teacher teaches in such a school.  The claim must 1) include the signature of the eligible teacher and of a representative of the school district employing the eligible teacher certifying that during the period for which financial assistance is claimed the school district was an eligible school district and the eligible teacher taught in a school operated by that eligible school district; 2) include a commitment by the eligible teacher that he or she will use the financial assistance to repay student loans incurred to defray the cost of tuition, fees, and expenses for programs of study relating to the teaching profession; and 3) provide such other information as HEAB may require by rule to verify the claimant's eligibility for financial assistance.\n\nThe maximum amount of financial assistance that an eligible teacher may receive under the grant program is $1,000 for the first school year, $2,000 for the second school year, $2,000 for the third school year, $2,000 for the fourth school year, and $3,000 for the fifth school year in which the eligible teacher participates in the grant program.  An eligible teacher may receive financial assistance under the grant program for no more than five school years.  No more than four eligible teachers employed by a given eligible school district may participate in the grant program in a given school year.\n\nFor further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB878,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  20.005 (3) (schedule) of the statutes:  at the appropriate place, insert 2the following amounts for the purposes indicated:\n - See PDF for table AB878,2\n\n\n3Section \n2.  20.235 (1) (fr) of the statutes is created to read:\nAB878,2,54\n20.235 (1) (fr)  Rural teacher grant program.

Larson, Ringhand and Harris Dodd. Referred to Committee on Health.\n\nAB880,2,2\n1An Act to repeal 46.245, 69.186 (1) (hf), 69.186 (1) (k), 69.186 (1) (L), 253.09, 2253.095, 253.10, 253.105, 253.107, 441.06 (6), 441.07 (1g) (f), 448.03 (5) (a), 3457.26 (2) (gm), 632.8985 and 940.04; to renumber and amend 940.32 (1) (a) 410.; to amend 20.9275 (1) (a), 48.375 (4) (a) 1., 448.02 (3) (a), 625.11 (4), 625.22 5(1), 628.34 (3) (b), 939.75 (2) (b) 1., 968.26 (1b) (a) 2. a., 990.001 (17) (b) and 6990.01 (19j) (b); to repeal and recreate 448.02 (3) (a); and to create 15.194 7(2), 15.197 (12m), chapter 258, subchapter VIII (title) of chapter 655 [precedes 8655.90], 655.90, 655.92, 655.94, 655.96 and 940.32 (1) (a) 11. of the statutes; 9relating to: medically accurate information, conscientious beliefs of 10reproductive health care providers, health care provider liability insurance, 11eliminating certain abortion requirements, prohibiting employment 1retribution and discrimination, actions against a person seeking or providing 2health care, and providing a criminal penalty.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nThis bill creates a right to medically accurate information, creates bodies for researching reproductive health issues, prohibits certain employment retribution and discrimination for health care providers, provides methods for health care providers to assert conscientious beliefs regarding reproductive health care services, makes various changes to abortion laws, specifies prohibited conduct regarding obtaining and providing health care and civil remedies and criminal penalties for committing that conduct, and regulating rates and other aspects of health care liability insurance.\n\nPatient Rights to Medically Accurate Information\n\nThis bill creates a right and obligation for a physician to provide medically accurate information to patients to whom the physician provides medical care.  The bill also creates a right for a patient to receive medically accurate information from a physician.  The bill prohibits interference or other diminishment of the rights and obligations relating to medically accurate information, and further prohibits employment retribution based upon a physician's exercise of the rights and obligations relating to the provision of medically accurate information.\n\nUnder the bill, the state, including any political subdivision or instrumentality of the state, may not do either of the following:  1) require any information that is not medically accurate to be included on a procedure or treatment form; or 2) prohibit a physician from including medically accurate information that or from deleting information that in the physician's medical judgment is either not medically accurate or not somehow relevant to the patient's specific request for care or treatment.\n\nThe bill creates an Office of Advancement in Medical Knowledge and Care that is required to investigate developments affecting patient rights and to submit an annual report of its findings.\n\nConscientious Beliefs\n\nThe bill requires a hospital that has a department or service offering maternity care services to permit all standard reproductive health care services and all maternity care services if the hospital has the capacity and capability.  The hospital must also provide an appropriate medical screening examination to any individual that comes to the hospital and for which a request for examination, treatment, or care for any standard reproductive health care service is made.\n\nUnder the bill, if a health care provider is available and it is within his or her training and license to provide or perform care appropriate for a patient's reproductive health care condition, the hospital must allow that provider to provide standard reproductive health care services, and reasonably accommodate and provide sufficient support for that provider in providing the care.  If a health care provider is not available to provide or perform care appropriate for a patient's reproductive health care condition, and the hospital determines the patient has an emergent or urgent medical condition, the hospital must provide examination and treatment to the extent required to stabilize the patient's condition, counsel the patient on all medically appropriate treatments specific to the patient's reproductive health care condition and circumstances, and offer and provide the patient with a referral for treatment.  After fulfilling these requirements, the hospital may transfer the patient to another medical facility when the patient is stable.\n\nThe bill allows a reproductive health care provider to provide to a hospital that has a department or service offering maternity care services one of the following:  1) a notice describing in detail the provider's conscientious belief and providing other information regarding that belief; 2) a notice that the provider, within his or her training and professional license, accepts and is ready to provide specific standard reproductive health care services identified in the provider's notice; or 3) a notice that the provider invokes applicable federal or state refusal rights and declines and objects to providing specific standard reproductive health care services identified in the provider's notice.  If any of the notices are submitted to a hospital, the bill requires, with certain exceptions, the hospital to honor the provider's stated conscientious beliefs.  A hospital may challenge a notice in certain circumstances.  If a provider accepts and is ready to provide specified reproductive health services, the hospital must annually prepare, adopt, implement, and make publicly available a written plan designed to estimate and meet the anticipated demand for services.  If a provider submits a notice declining and objecting to providing specific standard reproductive health care services and the hospital determines it will lack sufficient personnel to meet the demand for reproductive health care services, the hospital may require applicants for vacant reproductive health care provider positions to provide specific standard reproductive health care services.\n\nThe bill prohibits any person from interfering with, penalizing, or punishing a reproductive health care provider for asserting or exercising his or her conscientious beliefs, and provides civil remedies for violations relating to the assertion or exercise of these beliefs.\n\nAbortion\n\nThe bill makes various changes to the laws relating to abortion, including:\n\n1.  The bill eliminates requirements for voluntary and informed consent before the performance of an abortion.  Current law requires that a woman upon whom an abortion is to be performed or induced must give voluntary and informed written consent to an abortion.  Except in a medical emergency, a woman's consent to an abortion is considered information only if before the abortion is performed or induced at a time specified in current law, the physician or an assistant has, in person, orally provided the woman with certain information and given to the woman certain written materials.\n\n2.  The bill eliminates the requirement, effective February 1, 2016, that except in a medical emergency a physician must determine or rely on another determination of the probable postfertilization age of an unborn child before performing an abortion.  The bill also eliminates the prohibition on performing or inducing an abortion if the probable postfertilization age of the unborn child is 20 or more weeks.\n\n3.  This bill eliminates the prohibition on giving a woman an abortion-inducing drug unless the physician who provided the drug for the woman performs a physical exam on the woman and is physically present in the room when the drug is given to the woman.\n\n4.  The bill eliminates the current law prohibition on requiring a hospital to admit a patient for performing a sterilization or removing a human embryo or fetus.\n\n5.  The bill eliminates the liability exemption for hospitals or employees of hospitals who refuse to perform a sterilization or removal of a human embryo or fetus for religious or moral reasons.\n\n6.  The bill eliminates the prohibition against discriminating against a certain person because that person refuses to recommend, aid, or perform a sterilization or the removal of a human embryo or fetus for religious or moral reasons.\n\n7.  The bill eliminates the prohibition on coverage of abortions by qualified health plans offered through an exchange in this state.\n\n8.  The bill eliminates the prohibition on performing abortions by a physician that does not have admitting privileges in a hospital within 30 miles of the location where the abortion is to be performed.  Under a federal appellate court ruling, the requirement to have admitting privileges currently may not be enforced.\n\n9.  Under current law, any person, other than the mother, who intentionally destroys the life of an unborn child may be fined not more than $10,000, imprisoned for not more than six years, or both.  Any person, other than the mother, who intentionally destroys the life of an unborn quick child or causes the mother's death by an act done with intent to destroy the life of an unborn child may be fined not more than $50,000, imprisoned for not more than 15 years, or both.  None of these penalties apply to a therapeutic abortion that is performed by a physician; that is necessary, or advised by two other physicians as necessary, to save the life of the mother; and that is performed, except on an emergency basis, in a licensed maternity hospital.  These provisions were cited, along with other provisions not affected by this bill that prohibit performing an abortion generally, in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), as substantially similar to a Texas statute that was held to violate the due process clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  The bill repeals these provisions.  The bill, however, does not affect any other criminal prohibition or limitation on abortion in current law, such as the prohibition on performing an abortion after the fetus or unborn child has reached viability, or any other homicide prohibition.  The bill also does not affect a separate provision in current law that prohibits prosecution of and imposing or enforcing a fine or imprisonment against a woman who obtains an abortion or otherwise violates any abortion law with respect to her unborn child or fetus.\n\nEmployment Retribution and Discrimination Prohibition\n\nThe bill prohibits employment retribution and unfair discrimination against a health care provider based on the provider's involvement in a sterilization procedure, biomedical or behavioral research, or assertion or exercise of a conscientious belief to provide, or not provide, any standard reproductive health care services as described in the bill.  The bill also requires a hospital or health care facility to provide notice to an applicant of these prohibitions.\n\nUnless a health care provider provides express consent, the bill prohibits a hospital or health care facility from disclosing information about a health care provider's procedures, services, or research to the provider's prospective or potential employers, if the disclosure divulges activities that the hospital or health care provider could not use itself for disciplinary or other prohibited purposes under the prohibition of employment retribution and unfair discrimination.\n\nImplementation Health Care Task Force\n\nThis bill requires the Department of Health Services (DHS) to establish an Implementation Health Care Task Force with certain law enforcement and medical professionals that is required to examine and report annually upon the challenges and successes in achieving the implementation of state policies and rights described in the bill.\n\nProhibited Acts; Criminal and Civil Penalties\n\nThe bill prohibits several acts (prohibited acts) against a person seeking, obtaining or helping another person to obtain, or providing health care services (health care patient or provider).  The bill prohibits any person (actor) from injuring, intimidating, interfering with, or threatening a health care patient or provider.  An actor who does so or who intentionally engages in a pattern of aggressive or harassing conduct against a health care patient or provider, or who intentionally interferes with the property of a medical facility to impede or otherwise interfere with its efficiency, is guilty of a Class I felony.\n\nUnder the bill, an actor who intentionally damages property, including data or records kept by a health care provider, or who intentionally files frivolous lawsuits against a health care provider or communicates deprecatory information about a health care provider for the purpose of damaging or interfering with the operations of a health care provider is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor.\n\nAn actor who engages in a pattern of targeted and dangerous activity, including an act or threat of murder, kidnapping, arson, robbery, extortion, or other dangerous felonies, toward a health care provider is guilty of a Class E felony, as is an actor who commits any of the other prohibited acts toward a health care patient or provider if the actor knows or should know that his or her action will cause a specific person's death or injury, or will cause a reasonable person to suffer serious emotional distress or to reasonably fear death or substantial bodily injury to himself or herself or to his or her family member or member of his or her household, and the acts did have one of those effects.\n\nUnder the bill, a patient or health care provider who is affected by a prohibited act may file a civil action against the actor.  The bill allows a patient or health care provider to seek, in addition to injunctive relief and punitive damages, compensatory damages that reflect his or her actual damages or statutory damages of $20,000 per violation.\n\nUnder the bill, a patient or physician may also file a civil action for a violation related to the patient's right to accurate medical information and his or her right to access to high quality medical care.  The bill allows the person to seek, in addition to injunctive relief and punitive damages, compensatory damages that reflect his or her actual damages or statutory damages of $5,000 per violation.\n\nThe statutory damages option of $20,000 per violation is also available to a physician or health care provider who files a civil action after experiencing employment discrimination for his or her provision of medical care, after being prevented from providing medically accurate information to a patient, or after being required to provide medically inaccurate information to patient.  The same option is available to a patient or a health care provider who is negatively affected by a determination regarding the conscientious beliefs of a reproductive health care provider.\n\nThe bill also authorizes the attorney general to commence a civil action if he or she has reasonable cause to believe that a hospital or any person is interfering with another's right to health care, committing a criminal act against a patient or health care provider, or otherwise violating a patient's or health care provider's rights.\n\nUnder the bill, a court may award injunctive relief and compensatory damages and an additional assessment of up to $20,000 for the first violation and $40,000 for each subsequent violation.  If the court awards relief for a prohibited act, the court may assess an additional amount up to $100,000 for a first violation and $1,000,000 for each subsequent violation.\n\nInsurance Requirements\n\nThis bill creates requirements for health care liability insurance policies regarding classification and rates for such insurance, procedures for appealing classification or rates, and health care liability policy mandates.  These provisions include the following:\n\n1.  The bill requires that an insurer must classify certain procedures and medication regimens related to reproductive health and abortion in the same risk classes as other procedures with similar actuarial risks.  The bill also requires medically indicated abortions to be classified in the same risk classes as elective abortions.\n\n2.  Under current law, the commissioner of insurance has the authority to promulgate rules for the procedure under which a health care provider may challenge the classification and rates contained in its liability policy.  Under this bill, a health care provider is first required to exhaust all remedies contained in its insurance contract for challenging classification and rates.  This bill also codifies the procedure promulgated by the commissioner, which permits a health care provider to, after exhausting its remedies under the insurance contract, petition the commissioner for review of the classification and rates.  If the health care provider is not satisfied with the result of the petition, the health care provider may then appeal the decision to an administrative law judge.\n\n3.  Under current law, an insurer may not provide rates that are unfairly discriminatory.  Unfair discrimination occurs when one rate in relation to another does not reflect the differences in expected losses and expenses.  Under this bill, rates are also unfairly discriminatory if they consider political, social, ethical, or religious concerns associated with providing insurance for abortion procedures.  Rates are also unfairly discriminatory if an insurer charges a higher rate for services when there is incomplete actuarial data for assessing the risk.  The bill specifies that sound actuarial principles do not include political, social, ethical, and religious considerations, charging higher rates for services of which there is only incomplete data, and using incomplete data to limit liability associated with insuring unknown risks.\n\n4.  The bill provides that all health care liability insurance policies must include coverage for certain regimens, methods, and procedures, including contraceptive implant procedures, intrauterine contraception procedures, endometrial biopsies, medically indicated and elective abortions, miscarriages, and other procedures using intrauterine instrumentation for which the health care provider is trained.  The policies are also required to include coverage for counseling and follow-up services associated with these regimens, methods, and procedures.\n\nComprehensive Women's Health Research Council\n\nThe bill creates the Comprehensive Women's Health Research Council that is required to identify and assess the needs for research on voluntary termination of pregnancy, prioritize research projects most likely to improve health outcomes for women in Wisconsin, and propose ways and means to fund those projects.\n            Down\r\n        Down\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Up\r\n        Up\r\n\n\nFor further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB880,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  15.194 (2) of the statutes is created to read:\nAB880,7,52\n15.194 (2)  Office of advancement in medical knowledge and care.

If a provider submits a written notice under this paragraph, 6all of the following apply:\nAB880,27,87\n1.  A provider's assertion in a written notice of his or her conscientious belief 8under this paragraph is prima facie evidence of its validity.\nAB880,27,159\n2.  A hospital challenging the validity of a conscientious belief has the burden 10of showing by clear and convincing evidence that the provider's notice does not 11describe a conscientious belief.  If a hospital determines as a matter of fact that a 12notice does not describe a conscientious belief, the hospital shall issue findings of fact 13and explain in writing how the hospital has met the clear and convincing evidentiary 14standard in making its determination that the provider's notice did not describe a 15conscientious belief.\n            Down\r\n        Down\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Up\r\n        Up\r\nAB880,27,2016\n(b)  Give written notice to a hospital that has a department or service offering 17maternity care services that the provider, within his or her training and within the 18scope of his or her professional license, accepts and is ready to provide specific 19standard reproductive health care services identified in the notice.  If a provider 20submits a written notice under this paragraph, all of the following apply:\nAB880,28,321\n1.  The hospital shall honor the provider's conscientious belief, unless it is 22determined that the notice submitted by the provider did not describe a conscientious 23belief, and shall reasonably accommodate the provider's decisions, including, if 24specified, a decision to provide certain specific standard reproductive health care 25services, or for example, a decision to provide abortion services until the limit on the 1period of gestation under state law or until viability when no gestation limit is set 2by state law, provided that the hospital may deny an accommodation if it would 3create an undue hardship.\nAB880,28,104\n2.  To support, sustain, and accommodate provider decisions to provide specified 5reproductive health care services, both as a least restrictive means to ensure 6compliance with this section and as a means to achieve the state interests described 7in this section, the hospital shall annually prepare, adopt, implement, and make 8publicly available a written plan designed to estimate and meet the reasonably 9anticipated demand for all the standard reproductive health care services, and to 10provide the support and ancillary services as described in sub. (2).\nAB880,28,1511\n(c)  Give written notice to a hospital that has a department or service offering 12maternity care services that the provider, invoking applicable refusal rights in 13federal or state law, declines and objects to providing specific standard reproductive 14health care services identified in the notice.  If a provider submits a written notice 15under this paragraph, all of the following apply:\nAB880,28,2316\n1.  The hospital shall honor the provider's conscientious belief, unless it 17determined that the notice submitted by the provider did not identify applicable 18refusal rights in federal or state law or did not describe a conscientious belief, and 19shall reasonably accommodate the provider's decisions, provided that the hospital 20may deny an accommodation if it would create an undue hardship or precludes, 21under sub. (2), the provision of an appropriate medical screening examination or the 22provision of medically necessary care to an individual who has come to the hospital 23as specified in sub. (2).\nAB880,29,824\n2.  To support, sustain, and accommodate provider decisions to not provide 25specified reproductive health care services, both as a least restrictive means to 1ensure compliance with this section and as a means to achieve the state interests 2described in this section, the hospital is authorized, whenever the hospital 3determines that it will lack sufficient personnel to meet the reasonably anticipated 4demand for the services permitted under sub. (2), to obtain services necessary for 5both the delivery of safe health care and the provision of medically necessary care 6by requiring applicants for vacant reproductive health care provider positions to 7provide specific standard reproductive health care services as may be necessary to 8meet the reasonably anticipated demand for all services permitted under sub. (2).\nAB880,29,11\n9(4)  Interference.  No person may interfere with or otherwise penalize or 10punish a reproductive health care provider for asserting or exercising his or her 11conscientious belief under this section.\nAB880,29,13\n12(5)  Violations.  Any person violating this section shall be subject to the civil 13remedies under s. 258.55.\nAB880,30,8\n14(6)  State policies.  (a)  Discrimination in access to reproductive health care.  15Access to health care services and to accurate health care information is a basic and 16foundational human right.  Yet, in the realm of sexual and reproductive health care, 17in a health care system that is especially challenging to most anyone with a limited 18education or who lives in poverty or is victimized by family violence, gender-based 19health care discrimination profoundly limits access to standard reproductive health 20care services and safe motherhood, and thwarts the state's policy of promoting 21improved health care outcomes for all women and in honoring and protecting privacy 22rights inherent in their reproductive health care decisions.  With an awareness that 23some hospitals with a maternity department or services have the capability of 24permitting standard reproductive health care services but routinely restrict or deny 25women access to them, the state declares that failure to permit access to standard 1reproductive health care services for women and their willing reproductive health 2care providers is a form of invidious discrimination, and that the state has 3compelling governmental interests in public health and safety and the well-being of 4all its residents in ending this form of gender discrimination and in assuring that no 5one is deprived of privacy rights inherent in reproductive health care decision 6making.  Accordingly, it is the policy of this state that hospitals that offer maternity 7care services, permit patients with willing reproductive health care providers to have 8access to all standard reproductive health care services and maternity care services.\nAB880,30,199\n(b)  Honoring conscientious beliefs.  A commitment to providing standard 10reproductive health care services to patients and a strong objection to providing such 11services each qualify as sincerely held conscientious beliefs when predicated on a 12person's central core beliefs and values.  The state's governmental interest in public 13health and safety and the well-being of all its residents requires that the provision 14of medically necessary care be the paramount and constant concern of all health care 15providers.  Accordingly, it is the policy of this state, that hospitals that offer 16maternity care services, consistent with maintaining systems sufficient to ensure 17that women and their health care providers can access all standard reproductive 18health care services, shall honor and reasonably accommodate conscientious beliefs 19of direct providers of all standard reproductive health care services.\nAB880,30,20\n20258.50  Patient and health care provider protection.  (1)  In this section:\nAB880,30,2221\n(a)  \"Health care provider\" includes an individual who aids an individual to seek 22or obtain health care services.\nAB880,30,2323\n(b)  \"Patient\" has the meaning given in s. 258.05 (1).\nAB880,30,24\n24(2)  No person may do any of the following:\nAB880,31,11\n1(a)  Engage in conduct directed at a health care provider or a patient that 2injures, intimidates, harasses, interferes with, or threatens or attempts to injure, 3intimidate, harass, interfere with, or threaten the health care provider or patient, 4by use of force, threat of force, or physical obstruction if the person knows that the 5conduct will cause the health care provider or patient to suffer serious emotional 6distress or place him or her in reasonable fear of death or of great bodily harm to 7himself or herself or a member of his or her family or household, or will cause a 8reasonable person under the same circumstances to suffer serious emotional 9distress, or will place a reasonable person under the same circumstances in fear of 10death or bodily harm to himself or herself or a member of his or her family or 11household.\nAB880,31,1812\n(b)  Intentionally use, obstruct, manipulate, arrange, or rearrange, or attempt 13to use, obstruct, manipulate, arrange, or rearrange the property of a medical facility 14to impede or otherwise interfere with its efficiency, or attempt to engage in any of 15these actions, or file a lawsuit or administrative complaint against a health care 16provider that, when considering the action in its entirety, cannot be supported by any 17rational argument based in fact or law, or publish, distribute, or communicate in any 18form of deprecatory matter relating to a health care provider.\nAB880,31,2019\n(c)  For the purpose of damaging or interfering with the operations of a health 20care provider, and in connection with such purpose, doing any of the following:\nAB880,31,2421\n1.

Conspiring or attempting to engage in intentionally damaging property as 8described in subd. 1. or conspiring or attempting to intentionally place a person in 9reasonable fear of death or serious bodily injury as described in subd. 2.\nAB880,32,2010\n(d)  Engaging in a pattern of targeted and dangerous activity towards a health 11care provider.  For purposes of this paragraph, a pattern of targeted and dangerous 12activity exists when a person or group of individuals associated in fact commits 2 or 13more separate acts of targeted and dangerous activity towards a health care provider 14in which one act occurred after the effective date of this paragraph ....

That the identified specific conduct is protected by the person's right to 8engage in expressive conduct protected from legal prohibition by the constitutions 9of the state and the United States.\nAB880,33,1510\n2.  When the identified specific conduct concerns the filing of a lawsuit or 11administrative complaint, that the lawsuit or administrative complaint alleged acts 12against the party filing the lawsuit or against the party's child that are recognized 13under state law as constituting domestic violence under s. 813.12 (1) (am), sexual 14assault including sexual assault under s. 940.225, 948.06, or 948.09, or physical 15abuse of a child including physical abuse of a child under s. 948.03.\nAB880,33,1916\n3.  When the identified specific conduct concerns the publication, distribution, 17or communication of deprecatory matter, that all individuals specified in the 18deprecatory matter consented in writing to the publication, distribution, and 19communication of the deprecatory matter.\nAB880,33,21\n20(6)  The state hereby establishes, affirms, fosters, and promotes the following 213 fundamental policies and interests necessary for the public interest:\n            Down\r\n        Down\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Up\r\n        Up\r\nAB880,34,322\n(a)  The protection of health care providers in this state from becoming targets, 23without remedies, of intentional and frightening conduct directed toward them is 24critical to the state's significant and substantial governmental interest in health and 25safety. The public health and welfare of health care patients is preserved and 1promoted when unlawful and egregious acts directed towards health care providers 2are subject to state provided protections that minimize injuries sustained from such 3conduct.\nAB880,34,94\n(b)  The state legislature, relying on evidence that health care providers have 5historically and repeatedly been targeted for violence on account of the care they 6provide, finds that it serves a compelling governmental interest of this state to 7establish policies and laws that protect health care providers, their families, and 8their property from violence designed to damage or interfere with their operations, 9and from targeted and dangerous activities.\nAB880,34,1710\n(c)  The availability and assurance that patients have continuing access to 11medically accurate and comprehensive health care, including reproductive health 12care, and to health care providers who are neither impeded in providing those 13services nor exposed to risk of employment retribution and unfair discrimination in 14employment is central to the well being of all residents in this state, to the 15preservation of health care integrity and patient privacy, to the respect for the 16sanctity of the doctor-patient relationship, and to the freedom from governmental 17intrusion that is central to the doctor-patient relationship.\nAB880,34,19\n18258.53  Penalties.

Referred to Committee on Labor.\n\nAB882,1,3\n1An Act to create 103.12, 106.54 (11) and 111.91 (2) (gp) of the statutes; \nrelating 2to: requiring an employer to provide reasonable break time for an employee 3who is breast-feeding her child to express breast milk for the child.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nThis bill requires an employer, including the state, to provide the following for an employee who is breast-feeding her child under one year of age:  1) a reasonable break time to express breast milk for the child; 2) a private place, other than a bathroom, for the employee to express breast milk; and 3) access to an electrical outlet, running water, and a refrigerator for the storage of breast milk.  The bill permits that break time to be unpaid but requires an employer to treat such unpaid break time as paid work time for purposes of determining eligibility for health care coverage.\n\nThe federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) requires an employer engaged in interstate commerce, which is generally defined as an employer having an annual dollar volume of sales of $500,000 or more, to provide the following:  1) a reasonable break time for an employee to express breast milk for her nursing child for one year after the child's birth each time the employee needs to express that milk; and 2) a place, other than a bathroom, that is shielded from view and free from intrusion from coworkers and the public that may be used by an employee to express breast milk.  In addition, the FLSA permits that break time to be unpaid and provides that an employer that employs fewer than 50 employees is not subject to those requirements if those requirements would impose an undue hardship by causing the employer significant difficulty or expense when considered in relation to the size, financial resources, nature, or structure of the employer's business.\n\nThis bill codifies into the laws of this state the requirements of the FLSA with respect to reasonable break time for employees to express breast milk for their children under one year of age, applying those requirements to all employers, including the state, employing at least one individual.  In addition, the bill:  1) requires an employer to provide access to an electrical outlet, running water, and a refrigerator for the storage of breast milk; and 2) provides that if an employee's eligibility for an employer contribution towards the employee's health care coverage is dependent on the number of hours that the employee works, the employer must treat any unpaid break time taken by the employee to express breast milk as paid work time for purposes of determining that eligibility.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB882,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  103.12 of the statutes is created to read:\nAB882,2,8\n2103.12  Reasonable break time for nursing mothers.

Other counties are allowed, but not required, to enter into agreements with DOR to collect debt.  All such agreements must provide that DOR charge a collection fee to the county for collecting the debt.  Under current law, counties may enter into debt collection agreements with DOR, and DOR may charge an administrative fee for collecting debts.\n\nThe bill provides that a debt collection agreement between DOR and a county having a population of 750,000 or more and containing a first class city may take effect by the county executive's written proclamation, without any action being taken by, or approval needed from, the county board.  The county must certify for collection all debts that are more than 90 days past due, except the county may not certify for collection restitution owed to a person other than the county.  If DOR determines that any certified debts are uncollectible, DOR will notify the county of the uncollectible debts and the county may contract with another debt collector to collect those debts.\n\nThe bill also authorizes the county executive to establish a division of revenue within the county's department of administration that is responsible for the efficient collection of accounts receivable and the administration of debts collected by DOR.  The division is required to establish payment plans for debtors who meet certain income limitations.  In general, the division may offer payment plans, including installment plans, to a debtor whose annual household income is less than 150 percent of the federal poverty line for the size of the debtor's household.\n\nFinally, if DOR determines that the county has not certified its debts to DOR to the fullest extent possible, DOR will notify the county of the revenue that it would have collected had the the county completely certified its debts.  In addition, DOR will notify the county of the units of county government responsible for not certifying debts and the county must reduce its funding to such units in proportion to the amounts not collected.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB885,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  20.835 (6) of the statutes is created to read:\nAB885,2,52\n20.835 (6)  Debt collection.

The minimum payment under any such plan 12is the greater of $50 a month or the amount required to pay the debt in full by paying 13equal monthly installments for 36 months.  If a monthly payment under an 14installment plan, together with any monthly child support payments paid by the 1debtor, would reduce the debtor's annual household income to an amount that is 2below 100 percent of the poverty line established under 42 USC 9902 (2) for the size 3of debtor's household, the division may extend the debtor's installment plan beyond 436 months with a minimum monthly payment of $50.  The division may offer 5payment plans established under this subdivision to any of the following debtors:\nAB885,3,76\na.

The text also includes the February 17, 2016, chief clerk's corrections to Assembly Amendment 1 and the March 9, 2016, chief clerk's corrections to Assembly Amendment 3.\n\nContent of Engrossed 2015 Assembly Bill 885:\n\nThis bill requires that a county having a population of 750,000 or more and containing a first class city enter into an agreement with the Department of Revenue (DOR) to have DOR collect the county's debt, including debt owed to the county circuit court.  Other counties are allowed, but not required, to enter into agreements with DOR to collect debt.  All such agreements must provide that DOR charge a collection fee to the county for collecting the debt.  Under current law, counties may enter into debt collection agreements with DOR, and DOR may charge an administrative fee for collecting debts.\n\nThe bill provides that a debt collection agreement between DOR and a county having a population of 750,000 or more and containing a first class city may take effect by the county executive's written proclamation, without any action being taken by, or approval needed from, the county board.  The county must certify for collection all debts that are more than 90 days past due, except the county may not certify for collection restitution owed to a person other than the county.  If DOR determines that any certified debts are uncollectible, DOR will notify the county of the uncollectible debts and the county may contract with another debt collector to collect those debts.\n\nThe bill also authorizes the county executive to establish a division of revenue within the county's department of administration that is responsible for the efficient collection of accounts receivable and the administration of debts collected by DOR.  The division is required to establish payment plans for debtors who meet certain income limitations.  In general, the division may offer payment plans, including installment plans, to a debtor whose annual household income is less than 200 percent of the federal poverty line for the size of the debtor's household.\n\nFinally, if DOR determines that the county has not certified its debts to DOR to the fullest extent possible, DOR will notify the county of the revenue that it would have collected had the the county completely certified its debts.  In addition, DOR will notify the county of the units of county government responsible for not certifying debts and the county must reduce its funding to such units in proportion to the amounts not collected.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB885-engrossed,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  20.835 (6) of the statutes is created to read:\nAB885-engrossed,2,52\n20.835 (6)  Debt collection.

The executive director of the State of Wisconsin Investment Board (Investment Board), or his or her designee, who also serves as a nonvoting member.\n\nThe bill requires that the Reserve Board hire an executive director who has expertise in private equity investment.\n\nWisconsin Next Generation Reserve Fund\n\nThe bill creates a nonlapsible fund to be known as the \"Wisconsin next generation reserve fund\" (fund).  From the fund, the Reserve Board may make grants, loans, and investments, as set forth below.  For short-term management, the fund is included in the state investment fund managed by the Investment Board.\n\nIn addition to moneys from other sources, the fund consists of moneys generated from tax revenue collected from \"qualifying companies\" in the bioscience industry.  Under the bill, a qualifying company is identified by the company's principal business activity code under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  The bill directs the Department of Revenue (DOR) to determine in July 2016 the total amount of withholding taxes due and payable from qualifying companies for 2015.  Then, beginning on July 1, 2017, and ending on July 1, 2031, DOR must deposit in the fund an amount equal to 95 percent of the withholding taxes due and payable from qualifying companies the previous year that exceeds the total amount for 2015, except that DOR may not deposit more than $15,000,000 into the fund on July 1, 2017, or more than $50,000,000 on any July 1 thereafter.  DOR may not deposit more than a total of $350,000,000 into the fund.  However, the Joint Committee on Finance (JCF), under its passive review process, may approve deposits of up to an additional $150,000,000.\n\nGrants, loans, and investments\n\nFrom the fund, the bill authorizes the Reserve Board to make grants and loans to, and direct investments in, bioscience companies certified by the Reserve Board.  The Reserve Board may certify a bioscience company if the Reserve Board determines that the company is headquartered and employs at least 75 percent of its employees in Wisconsin and meets certain other conditions, including that the company is developing biotechnology or bioscience or bioscience research methods and demonstrates the potential to generate high levels of successful investment performance and increase employment in Wisconsin.\n\nBefore providing any moneys from the fund to a certified bioscience company, the Reserve Board must enter into a contract with the company that includes all of the following requirements:\n\n1.  The company must use a grant, loan, or investment from the fund for research and development related to biotechnology or bioscience or bioscience research methods.\n\n2.  The company must match the amount of any grant, loan, or investment from the fund with moneys the company has raised from other sources.\n\n3.  During the term of the contract, the company may not relocate its headquarters outside of Wisconsin without the Reserve Board's approval.\n\nContracting authority\n\nIn addition to its general contracting authority, the bill authorizes the Reserve Board to execute a contract with the Investment Board for the Investment Board's advice and services related to the Reserve Board's grants, loans, and investments and for facilities provided by the Investment Board.  Under the bill, the Investment Board may also make a loan to the Reserve Board for the Reserve Board's initial operations and administrative expenses.\n\nThe bill further authorizes the Investment Board to provide advice, services, and facilities to any state agency or authority or a business entity owned by an agency or authority.  Under the bill, the Investment Board may provide advice or services related to the management or administration, for any purpose, including economic development, of money or property that an agency, authority, or eligible business entity controls.  The agency, authority, or eligible business entity must contract with the Investment Board and pay the Investment Board for any advice, services, or facilities the Investment Board provides.\n\nReporting and review\n\nThe bill requires the Reserve Board to file a detailed annual report with the legislature that includes all of the following:\n\n1.  An accounting of the revenue deposited in the fund by DOR.\n\n2.  An accounting of all expenditures from the fund by the Reserve Board for any purpose.\n\n3.  Information concerning each grant or loan to, or investment in, a certified bioscience company, including a description of the purposes for which the certified bioscience company used or is using the grant, loan, or investment and a statement of the number of employees the certified bioscience company employed on January 1 of the preceding year and the number of employees the company employed on December 31 of that year.\n\n4.  An accounting of the internal rate of return realized by the Reserve Board on its total loans to, and investments in, certified bioscience companies.\n\n5.  An accounting of the internal rate of return realized by the Reserve Board on each loan to or investment in each certified bioscience company.\n\nFinally, the bill requires the Reserve Board to submit a plan to JCF at the close of each fiscal biennium that shows the grants, loans, and investments the Reserve Board intends to make during the next fiscal biennium.  The joint committee on finance may approve, disapprove, or modify and approve the Reserve Board's plan under JCF's passive review process.\n\n\nFor further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB888,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  15.07 (1) (a) 6. of the statutes is created to read:\nAB888,4,32\n15.07 (1) (a) 6.

A tenured faculty member could be dismissed only for just cause.

A fee, in addition to the regular registration fee for the particular kind of vehicle, is charged for the issuance or reissuance of most special plates.\n\nThis bill establishes an authorized special group specifically enumerated in state law for persons interested in obtaining special plates expressing support for certain professional basketball teams.  In addition to the regular vehicle registration fee, special group members are required to pay a $15 fee for issuance or reissuance of the special plates and to annually include a voluntary payment of $25.  Funds from the voluntary payment are retained by DOT until DOT recovers the lesser of $23,700 or the amount of the initial costs of production of these special plates.  After this, the voluntary payment is divided into equal payments to the Milwaukee Bucks Foundation, the city of Milwaukee, Milwaukee County, and a certain local exposition district.  The bill requires that the special plates' design be approved by the president of the Milwaukee Bucks.  DOT may not issue these special plates until DOT has obtained authority to use any applicable trademark or service mark associated with the professional basketball team.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB899,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  20.395 (5) (fg) of the statutes is created to read:\nAB899,2,42\n20.395 (5) (fg)  Basketball plate payments to the Milwaukee Bucks Foundation.  3From the general fund, all moneys received under s. 341.14 (6r) (b) 17. a. for 4payments to the Milwaukee Bucks Foundation.\nAB899,2\n\n\n5Section \n2.  20.395 (5) (fh) of the statutes is created to read:\nAB899,2,86\n20.395 (5) (fh)  Basketball plate payments to the city of Milwaukee.

If in determining whether an impasse exists the commission finds that 7the procedures under this paragraph have not been complied with and that the 8compliance would tend to result in a settlement, it may order compliance before 9ordering arbitration.  The validity of any arbitration award or collective bargaining 10agreement is not affected by failure to comply with the procedures.  Prior to the close 11of the investigation each party shall submit in writing to the commission its single 12final offer containing its final proposals on all issues in dispute that are subject to 13interest arbitration under this subdivision.  If a party fails to submit a single final 14offer, the commission shall close the investigation based on the last written position 15of the party.  Such final offers may include only mandatory subjects of bargaining, 16except that a permissive subject of bargaining may be included by a party if the other 17party does not object and shall then be treated as a mandatory subject.  The parties 18shall also submit to the commission a written stipulation with respect to all matters 19that are agreed upon for inclusion in the new or amended collective bargaining 20agreement.  The commission, after receiving a report from its investigator and 21determining that arbitration should be commenced, shall issue an order requiring 22arbitration and immediately submit to the parties a list of 7 arbitrators.  The parties 23shall alternately strike names from the list until a single name is left, who shall be 24appointed as arbitrator.  The petitioning party shall notify the commission in writing 25of the identity of the arbitrator selected.  Upon receipt of the notice, the commission 1shall formally appoint the arbitrator and submit to him or her the final offers of the 2parties.  The final offers are public documents and the commission shall make them 3available.  In lieu of a single arbitrator and upon request of both parties, the 4commission shall appoint a tripartite arbitration panel consisting of one member 5selected by each of the parties and a neutral person designated by the commission 6who shall serve as a chairperson.  An arbitration panel has the same powers and 7duties as provided in this section for any other appointed arbitrator, and all 8arbitration decisions by a panel shall be determined by majority vote.  In place of 9selection of the arbitrator by the parties and upon request of both parties, the 10commission shall establish a procedure for randomly selecting names of arbitrators.  11Under the procedure, the commission shall submit a list of 7 arbitrators to the 12parties.  Each party shall strike one name from the list.  From the remaining 5 13names, the commission shall randomly appoint an arbitrator.  Unless both parties 14to an arbitration proceeding otherwise agree in writing, every individual whose 15name is submitted by the commission for appointment as an arbitrator must be a 16resident of this state at the time of submission and every individual who is 17designated as an arbitration panel chairperson must be a resident of this state at the 18time of designation.\nAB900,56,419\nb.  The arbitrator shall, within 10 days of his or her appointment, establish a 20date and place for the arbitration hearing.  Upon petition of at least 5 citizens of the 21jurisdiction served by the municipal employer, filed within 10 days after the date on 22which the arbitrator is appointed, the arbitrator shall hold a public hearing in the 23jurisdiction to provide the opportunity to both parties to explain or present 24supporting arguments for their positions and to members of the public to offer their 25comments and suggestions.  The final offers of the parties, as transmitted by the 1commission to the arbitrator, are the basis for any continued negotiations between 2the parties with respect to the issues in dispute.

Prior to the arbitration hearing, either party may, within a time limit 6established by the arbitrator, withdraw its final offer and any mutually agreed upon 7modifications and shall immediately provide written notice of any withdrawal to the 8other party, the arbitrator, and the commission.  If both parties withdraw their final 9offers and mutually agreed upon modifications, the labor organization, after giving 1010 days' written notice to the municipal employer and the commission, may strike.  11Unless both parties withdraw their final offers and mutually agreed upon 12modifications, the final offer of neither party is considered withdrawn and the 13arbitrator shall proceed to resolve the dispute by final and binding arbitration as 14provided in this paragraph.\nAB900,57,215\nd.  Before issuing his or her arbitration decision, the arbitrator shall, on his or 16her own motion or at the request of either party, conduct a meeting open to the public 17to provide to both parties the opportunity to explain or present supporting 18arguments for their complete offer on all matters to be covered by the proposed 19agreement.  The arbitrator shall adopt without modification the final offer of one of 20the parties on all disputed issues submitted under subd. 6. am., except those items 21that the commission determines not to be mandatory subjects of bargaining and 22those items that have not been treated as mandatory subjects by the parties, and 23including any prior modifications of the offer mutually agreed upon by the parties 24under subd. 6. b.

(b), the proceedings 11under subd. 6. c. and d. may not occur until the commission renders a decision in the 12matter and the decision is final.

(name of the voter's current collective 21bargaining unit) elect to participate in collective bargaining, which labor 22organization do you favor to act as representative of the employees?\"  The 3rd 23question may not include a choice for no representative.  All employees in the 24collective bargaining unit may vote on all questions.  Unless a majority of those 25employees voting in the election vote to participate in collective bargaining, no votes 1for combination or for a particular representative may be counted.  If a majority of 2those employees voting in the election vote to participate in collective bargaining, the 3ballots for combination shall be counted.  If the ballots for combination are counted 4and a majority of those employees voting from each collective bargaining unit listed 5in the 2nd question on the ballot vote to combine, then the ballots for representatives 6of the combined collective bargaining unit shall be counted.  If the ballots for 7combination are counted and a majority of those employees voting from each 8collective bargaining unit listed in the 2nd question on the ballot do not vote to 9combine, then the ballots for representatives of each current collective bargaining 10unit shall be counted.\nAB900,101,1211\n(c)  The commission's certification of the results of any election is conclusive 12unless reviewed under s. 111.07 (8).\nAB900,101,19\n13(3)  Whenever an election has been conducted under sub. (2) in which the ballots 14for representatives have been counted but in which no named representative is 15favored by a majority of the employees voting, the commission may, if requested by 16a party to the proceeding within 30 days from the date of the certification of the 17results of the election, conduct a runoff election.  In that runoff election, the 18commission shall drop from the ballot the name of the representative who received 19the least number of votes at the original election.\nAB900,102,7\n20(4)  While a collective bargaining agreement between a labor organization and 21an employer is in force under this subchapter, a petition for an election in the 22collective bargaining unit to which the agreement applies may be filed only during 23October in the calendar year prior to the expiration of that agreement.  An election 24held under that petition may be held only if the petition is supported by proof that 25at least 30 percent of the employees in the collective bargaining unit desire a change 1or discontinuance of existing representation.  Within 60 days of the time that an 2original petition is filed, another petition may be filed supported by proof that at least 310 percent of the employees in the same collective bargaining unit desire a different 4representative.  If a majority of the employees in the collective bargaining unit vote 5for a change or discontinuance of representation by any named representative, the 6decision takes effect upon expiration of any existing collective bargaining agreement 7between the employer and the existing representative.\nAB900,102,9\n8111.991  Unfair labor practices.  (1)  It is an unfair labor practice for an 9employer individually or in concert with others to do any of the following:\nAB900,102,1110\n(a)  Interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of their rights 11guaranteed under s. 111.97.\nAB900,102,2412\n(b)  Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, initiate, create, dominate, 13or interfere with the formation or administration of any labor or employee 14organization or contribute financial support to it.  Except as provided in ss. 40.02 (22) 15(e) and 40.23 (1) (f) 4., no change in any law affecting the Wisconsin Retirement 16System under ch. 40 and no action by the employer that is authorized by such a law 17is a violation of this paragraph unless an applicable collective bargaining agreement 18specifically prohibits the change or action.  No such change or action affects the 19continuing duty to bargain collectively regarding the Wisconsin Retirement System 20under ch. 40 to the extent required by s. 111.998.  It is not an unfair labor practice 21for the employer to reimburse an employee at his or her prevailing wage rate for the 22time spent during the employee's regularly scheduled hours conferring with the 23employer's officers or agents and for attendance at commission or court hearings 24necessary for the administration of this subchapter.\nAB900,103,4\n1(c)  Encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization by 2discrimination in regard to hiring, tenure, or other terms or conditions of 3employment.  This paragraph does not apply to fair-share or maintenance of 4membership agreements.\nAB900,103,145\n(d)  Refuse to bargain collectively on matters set forth in s. 111.998 with a 6representative of a majority of its employees in an appropriate collective bargaining 7unit.  Whenever the employer has a good faith doubt as to whether a labor 8organization claiming the support of a majority of its employees in an appropriate 9collective bargaining unit does in fact have that support, it may file with the 10commission a petition requesting an election as to that claim.  The employer is not 11considered to have refused to bargain until an election has been held and the results 12of the election are certified to the employer by the commission.  A violation of this 13paragraph includes the refusal to execute a collective bargaining agreement 14previously orally agreed upon.\nAB900,103,1915\n(e)  Violate any collective bargaining agreement previously agreed upon by the 16parties with respect to wages, hours, and conditions of employment affecting the 17employees, including an agreement to arbitrate or to accept the terms of an 18arbitration award, when previously the parties have agreed to accept such award as 19final and binding upon them.\nAB900,104,220\n(f)  Deduct labor organization dues from an employee's earnings, unless the 21employer has been presented with an individual order therefor, signed by the 22employee personally, and terminable by at least the end of any year of its life or 23earlier by the employee giving at least 30 but not more than 120 days' written notice 24of such termination to the employer and to the representative labor organization, 25except if there is a fair-share or maintenance of membership agreement in effect.  1The employer shall give notice to the labor organization of receipt of such notice of 2termination.\nAB900,104,63\n(g)  Use any moneys received for any purpose to discourage; to train any 4supervisor, management employee, or other employee to discourage; or to contract 5with any person for the purposes of discouraging employees in the exercise of their 6rights guaranteed under s. 111.97.\nAB900,104,13\n7(1m)  Notwithstanding sub. (1), it is not an unfair labor practice for the board 8to implement changes in salaries or conditions of employment for members of the 9faculty or academic staff at one institution, and not for other members of the faculty 10or academic staff at another institution, but this may be done only if the differential 11treatment is based on comparisons with the compensation and working conditions 12of employees performing similar services for comparable higher education 13institutions or based upon other competitive factors.\nAB900,104,15\n14(2)  It is unfair practice for an employee individually or in concert with others 15to do any of the following:\nAB900,104,1716\n(a)  Coerce or intimidate an employee in the enjoyment of the employee's legal 17rights, including those guaranteed under s. 111.97.\nAB900,104,2218\n(b)  Coerce, intimidate, or induce any officer or agent of the employer to interfere 19with any of the employer's employees in the enjoyment of their legal rights including 20those guaranteed under s. 111.97 or engage in any practice with regard to its 21employees which would constitute an unfair labor practice if undertaken by the 22officer or agent on the officer's or agent's own initiative.\n            Down\r\n        Down\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Up\r\n        Up\r\nAB900,105,223\n(c)  Refuse to bargain collectively on matters specified in s. 111.998 with the 24authorized officer or agent of the employer that is the recognized or certified 25exclusive collective bargaining representative of employees in an appropriate 1collective bargaining unit.  Such refusal to bargain shall include a refusal to execute 2a collective bargaining agreement previously orally agreed upon.\nAB900,105,63\n(d)  Violate the provisions of any written agreement with respect to terms and 4conditions of employment affecting employees, including an agreement to arbitrate 5or to accept the terms of an arbitration award, when previously the parties have 6agreed to accept such awards as final and binding upon them.\nAB900,105,87\n(e)  Engage in, induce, or encourage any employees to engage in a strike or a 8concerted refusal to work or perform their usual duties as employees.\nAB900,105,129\n(f)  Coerce or intimidate a supervisory employee, officer, or agent of the 10employer, working at the same trade or profession as the employer's employees, to 11induce the person to become a member of or act in concert with the labor organization 12of which the employee is a member.\nAB900,105,16\n13(3)  It is an unfair labor practice for any person to do or cause to be done on 14behalf of or in the interest of employers or employees, or in connection with or to 15influence the outcome of any controversy as to employment relations, any act 16prohibited by subs. (1) and (2).\nAB900,105,18\n17(3m)  This section does not interfere with a faculty member's right of academic 18freedom.\nAB900,106,2\n19(4)  Any controversy concerning unfair labor practices may be submitted to the 20commission as provided in s. 111.07, except that the commission shall schedule a 21hearing on complaints involving alleged violations of sub. (2) (e) within 3 days after 22filing of a complaint, and notice shall be given to each party interested by service on 23the party personally, or by telegram, advising the party of the nature of the complaint 24and of the date, time, and place of hearing.  The commission may appoint a substitute 25tribunal to hear unfair labor practice charges by either appointing a 3-member panel 1or submitting a 7-member panel to the parties and allowing each to strike 2 names.  2Any panel shall report its finding to the commission for appropriate action.\nAB900,106,8\n3111.992  Fair-share and maintenance of membership agreements.  (1) 4(a) 1.  No fair-share agreement is effective unless authorized by a referendum.  The 5commission shall order a referendum whenever it receives a petition supported by 6proof that at least 30 percent of the employees, or supervisors specified in s. 111.98 7(5), in a collective bargaining unit desire that a fair-share agreement be entered into 8between the employer and a labor organization.\nAB900,106,109\n2.  For a fair-share agreement to be authorized, at least a majority of the eligible 10employees or supervisors voting in a referendum must vote in favor of the agreement.\nAB900,106,1411\n(b)  No maintenance of membership agreement may be effective unless 12authorized.  For a maintenance of membership agreement to be authorized, the 13employer and the labor organization representing the employees must voluntarily 14agree to establish the maintenance of membership agreement.\nAB900,107,815\n(c)  If a fair-share agreement is authorized in a referendum, the employer shall 16enter into a fair-share agreement with the labor organization named on the ballot 17in the referendum.  If a maintenance of membership agreement is authorized under 18par. (b), the employer shall enter into the maintenance of membership agreement 19with the labor union that voluntarily agreed to establish the agreement.  Each 20fair-share or maintenance of membership agreement shall require the employer to 21deduct the amount of dues as certified by the labor organization from the earnings 22of the employees or supervisors affected by the agreement and to pay the amount 23deducted to the labor organization.  Unless the parties agree to an earlier date, a 24fair-share agreement takes effect 60 days after the commission certifies that the 25referendum vote authorized the fair-share agreement, and unless the parties agree 1to an earlier date a maintenance of membership agreement takes effect 60 days after 2the commission certifies that the parties have voluntarily agreed to establish the 3maintenance of membership agreement.  The employer shall be held harmless 4against any claims, demands, suits, and other forms of liability made by employees 5or supervisors or local labor organizations which may arise for actions the employer 6takes in compliance with this section.  All such lawful claims, demands, suits, and 7other forms of liability are the responsibility of the labor organization entering into 8the agreement.\nAB900,107,149\n(d)  Under each fair-share or maintenance of membership agreement, an 10employee or supervisor who has religious convictions against dues payments to a 11labor organization may request the labor organization to pay his or her dues to a 12charity mutually agreed upon by the employee or supervisor and the labor 13organization.  Any dispute under this paragraph may be submitted to the 14commission for adjudication.\nAB900,108,2\n15(2) (a) 1.  Once authorized, a fair-share agreement continues, subject to the 16right of the employer or labor organization concerned to petition the commission to 17conduct a new referendum.  If the commission receives a petition and finds that at 18least 30 percent of the employees or supervisors in the collective bargaining unit 19want to discontinue the fair-share agreement, the commission shall conduct a new 20referendum.  If the continuance of the fair-share agreement is approved in the 21referendum by at least the percentage of eligible voting employees or supervisors 22required for its initial authorization, it shall continue, subject to the right of the 23employer or labor organization to later initiate a further vote following the procedure 24prescribed in this subsection.  If the continuance of the fair-share agreement is not 25supported in any referendum, it terminates at the termination of the collective 1bargaining agreement, or one year from the date of the certification of the result of 2the referendum, whichever is earlier.\nAB900,108,83\n2.  Once authorized, a maintenance of membership agreement is in effect, 4subject to the right of the employer or the labor organization concerned to notify the 5commission that it no longer voluntarily agrees to continue the agreement.  After the 6commission is notified, the maintenance of membership agreement terminates at the 7termination of the collective bargaining agreement or one year from the notification, 8whichever is earlier.\nAB900,108,179\n(b)  The commission shall suspend any fair-share or maintenance of 10membership agreement upon such conditions and for such time as the commission 11decides whenever it finds that the labor organization involved has refused on the 12basis of race, color, sexual orientation, or creed to receive as a member any employee 13or supervisor in the collective bargaining unit involved, and the agreement shall be 14made subject to the findings and orders of the commission.  Any of the parties to the 15agreement, or any employee or supervisor covered under the agreement, may come 16before the commission, as provided in s. 111.07, and petition the commission to make 17such a finding.\nAB900,108,20\n18(3)  A stipulation for a referendum executed by an employer and a labor 19organization may not be filed until after the representation election has been held 20and the results certified.\nAB900,108,23\n21(4)  The commission may, under rules adopted for that purpose, appoint as its 22agent an official of a state agency whose employees are entitled to vote in a 23referendum to conduct a referendum under this section.\nAB900,109,3\n24111.993  Grievance arbitration.  (1)  Parties to the dispute pertaining to the 25interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement may agree in writing to have the 1commission or any other appointing state agency serve as arbitrator or may 2designate any other competent, impartial, and disinterested persons to so serve.  3Such arbitration proceedings shall be governed by ch. 788.\nAB900,109,9\n4(2)  The board shall charge an institution for the employer's share of the cost 5related to grievance arbitration under sub. (1) for any arbitration that involves one 6or more employees of the institution.  Each institution charged shall pay the amount 7that the board charges from the appropriation account or accounts used to pay the 8salary of the grievant.  Funds received under this subsection shall be credited to the 9appropriation account under s. 20.545 (1) (km).\nAB900,109,15\n10111.994  Mediation.  The commission may appoint any competent, impartial, 11disinterested person to act as mediator in any labor dispute either upon its own 12initiative or upon the joint request of both parties to the dispute.  It is the function 13of a mediator to bring the parties together voluntarily under such favorable 14conditions as will tend to effectuate settlement of the dispute, but neither the 15mediator nor the commission has any power of compulsion in mediation proceedings.\nAB900,109,24\n16111.995  Fact-finding.  (1)  If a dispute has not been settled after a reasonable 17period of negotiation and after the settlement procedures, if any, established by the 18parties have been exhausted, the representative that has been certified by the 19commission after an election, as the exclusive representative of employees in an 20appropriate bargaining unit, and the employer, its officers, and agents, after a 21reasonable period of negotiation, are deadlocked with respect to any dispute between 22them arising in the collective bargaining process, either party, or the parties jointly, 23may petition the commission, in writing, to initiate fact-finding under this section, 24and to make recommendations to resolve the deadlock.\nAB900,110,6\n1(2)  Upon receipt of a petition to initiate fact-finding, the commission shall 2make an investigation with or without a formal hearing, to determine whether a 3deadlock in fact exists.  The commission shall certify the results of the investigation.  4If the commission decides that fact-finding should be initiated, it shall appoint a 5qualified, disinterested person or, when jointly requested by the parties, a 3-member 6panel to function as a fact finder.\nAB900,110,20\n7(3)  The fact finder may establish dates and place of hearings and shall conduct 8the hearings under rules established by the commission.  Upon request, the 9commission shall issue subpoenas for hearings conducted by the fact finder.  The fact 10finder may administer oaths.  Upon completion of the hearing, the fact finder shall 11make written findings of fact and recommendations for solution of the dispute and 12shall cause the same to be served on the parties and the commission.  In making 13findings and recommendations, the fact finder shall take into consideration among 14other pertinent factors the principles vital to the public interest in efficient and 15economical governmental administration.  Upon the request of either party, the fact 16finder may orally present the recommendations in advance of service of the written 17findings and recommendations.  Cost of fact-finding proceedings shall be divided 18equally between the parties.  At the time the fact finder submits a statement of his 19or her costs to the parties, the fact finder shall submit a copy to the commission at 20its Madison office.\nAB900,110,22\n21(4)  A fact finder may mediate a dispute at any time prior to the issuance of the 22fact finder's recommendations.\nAB900,111,3\n23(5)  Within 30 days of the receipt of the fact finder's recommendations or within 24a time mutually agreed upon by the parties, each party shall advise the other, in 25writing, as to the party's acceptance or rejection, in whole or in part, of the fact 1finder's recommendations and, at the same time, send a copy of the notification to 2the commission at its Madison office.  Failure to comply with this subsection, by the 3employer or employee representative, is a violation of s. 111.991 (1) (d) or (2) (c).\nAB900,111,9\n4111.996  Strike prohibited.  (1)  Upon establishing that a strike is in progress, 5the employer may either seek an injunction or file an unfair labor practice charge 6with the commission under s. 111.991 (2) (e) or both.  It is the responsibility of the 7board to decide whether to seek an injunction or file an unfair labor practice charge.  8The existence of an administrative remedy does not constitute grounds for denial of 9injunctive relief.\nAB900,111,12\n10(2)  The occurrence of a strike and the participation in the strike by an employee 11do not affect the rights of the employer, in law or in equity, to deal with the strike, 12including all of the following:\nAB900,111,1413\n(a)  The right to impose discipline, including discharge, or suspension without 14pay, of any employee participating in the strike.\nAB900,111,1615\n(b)  The right to cancel the reinstatement eligibility of any employee engaging 16in the strike.\n            Down\r\n        Down\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Up\r\n        Up\r\nAB900,111,1917\n(c)  The right of the employer to request the imposition of fines, either against 18the labor organization or the employee engaging in the strike, or to sue for damages 19because of such strike activity.\nAB900,111,22\n20111.997  Management rights.

In general, a student is eligible for a grant under the program if the student: 1) is a resident enrolled at least half-time in a public institution; 2) has completed counseling explaining the program; and 3) signs an agreement that includes a promise to graduate with a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.0 and a promise to be continuously employed, subject to certain grace periods, within this state for at least three years after graduation.  The grant amount is the amount of the student's tuition and other educational expenses after other financial aid in the form of grants and scholarships has been applied, based on the tuition and expenses level in the student's first year of enrollment and extended for the greater of four semesters or 60 credits.  However, with an exception, if a student who receives a grant fails to comply with the terms of the agreement described in item 3), above, the grant converts to a loan that must be repaid at an annual interest rate of 5 percent.  HEAB must, by rule, provide for a hardship exception under which the student may obtain a waiver under which the grant is not converted to a loan as a result of the student's failure to comply with the terms of the agreement.

Taylor, cosponsored by Senators Harris Dodd, L. Taylor, Bewley, Vinehout and C. Larson. Referred to Committee on State Affairs and Government Operations.\n\nAB904,1,5\n1An Act to amend 104.035 (1) (a), 104.035 (2) (a), 104.035 (2m) (a), 104.035 (3) 2(a) (intro.), 104.035 (4) (a), 104.035 (5) and 104.035 (6); and to create 15.227 (1), 319.85 (1) (ej), 104.01 (5d) and 104.065 of the statutes; relating to: creation of 4a Wage Council to study and make recommendations concerning increases in 5the minimum wage and granting rule-making authority.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nThis bill creates a Wage Council in the Department of Workforce Development and requires the Wage Council, early in each regular session of the legislature, to convene for the purpose of studying the need for an increase in the minimum wage and making recommendations to DWD for any changes in the minimum wage that may be necessary to ensure that the wages paid to any employee are sufficient to enable the employee to maintain himself or herself under conditions consistent with his or her welfare (living wage).  The Wage Council, in conducting that study and making those recommendations, and DWD, in revising the minimum wage, must consider 1) any changes in the consumer price index; 2) the effect of those changes on the real income of employees in this state; and 3) the effect that an increase in the minimum wage might have on the economy of the state, including the effect of a minimum wage increase on job creation, retention, and expansion; on the availability of entry-level jobs; and on regional economic conditions within the state.  If DWD approves the findings and recommendations of the Wage Council, DWD may promulgate rules to revise the minimum wage.\n\nFinally, under the bill, the biennial minimum wage revision procedure specified in the bill does not preclude DWD from convening the Wage Council at other times during the regular session of the legislature if, upon investigation, DWD finds that there is reasonable cause to believe that the wages paid to any employee are not a living wage.  If DWD so convenes the Wage Council, the Wage Council so convened must study the need for an increase in the minimum wage and report its recommendations as provided in the bill.\n\nUnder current law, the minimum wage is established by statute at $7.25 per hour for employees generally, minor employees, and agricultural employees; at $5.90 per hour for employees under 20 years of age who are in their first 90 consecutive days of employment with their employer (opportunity employees); at $2.33 per hour for tipped employees; and at $2.13 per hour for tipped opportunity employees.  Currently, DWD is authorized to establish a minimum wage by rule only for workers with a disability, student learners, and students employed at an independent college or university for less than 20 hours per week.\n\nFor further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB904,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  15.227 (1) of the statutes is created to read:\nAB904,2,32\n15.227 (1)  Wage council.

If the court does not extend 1probation, it shall issue a judgment for the unpaid restitution and direct the clerk 2of circuit court to file and enter the judgment in the judgment and lien docket, 3without fee, unless it finds that the victim has already recovered a judgment against 4the probationer for the damages covered by the restitution order.  If the court issues 5a judgment for the unpaid restitution, the court shall send to the person at his or her 6last-known address written notification that a civil judgment has been issued for the 7unpaid restitution.

Referred to Committee on Corrections.\n\nAB907,1,9\n1An Act to repeal 6.29 (2) (am), 6.55 (2) (cs), 6.55 (3) (b), 6.56 (3m), 6.79 (2) (dm), 26.88 (3) (c), 301.03 (20m), 302.117, 304.078 (1) and 973.09 (4m); to renumber 36.55 (3) (a); to renumber and amend 6.03 (1) (b) and 304.078 (3); to amend 46.33 (1), 6.33 (2) (a), 6.36 (1) (a), 7.52 (6), 301.03 (3a) (intro.), 304.078 (2) and 5973.176 (2); and to create 6.03 (1) (b) 1., 2., 3. and 4. of the statutes; relating 6to: restoring the right to vote to certain persons barred from voting as a result 7of a felony conviction, changing the information required on voter registration 8forms, and changing voting procedure for certain persons who are convicted of 9felonies.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nUnder current law, when a person is barred from voting as the result of a felony conviction (a \"disqualifying offense\"), the person's right to vote may be restored through a pardon.  Otherwise, it is restored when the person completes his or her sentence, including extended supervision or parole, or any term of probation imposed.\n\nUnder this bill, a person loses his or her right to vote based on a disqualifying offense only while he or she is incarcerated for that offense.  A person released to extended supervision or parole may resume voting.  In addition, a person convicted of a disqualifying offense and on probation retains the right to vote while on probation unless he or she is confined as a condition of probation.  But if a person who committed a disqualifying offense is incarcerated after the revocation of extended supervision, parole, or probation, the person loses the right to vote until he or she is released.\n\nCurrently, an applicant for voter registration must affirm:  1) whether he or she has been convicted of a felony for which he or she has not been pardoned and, if so, whether the applicant is incarcerated or on parole, probation, or extended supervision; and 2) whether the applicant is disqualified on any other ground from voting.  This bill deletes the requirement that an applicant provide any information relating to a felony conviction but retains the requirement that an applicant affirm that he or she is not disqualified on any ground from voting.\n\nCurrently, election officials are required to verify the eligibility of electors who vote at an election or who register to vote at an election after the close of voter registration for that election by checking each elector's name against a list provided by the Department of Corrections (DOC) that contains the names of convicted felons who have not completed their sentences and have not been pardoned.  If a person's name appears on the list, the election officials are directed to allow the person to vote if he or she is otherwise eligible, but to mark and challenge the elector's ballot for possible later review.  This bill deletes the requirements for DOC to provide the list of convicted felons and for election officials to review the names on the list.\n\nThe bill also requires DOC, the Government Accountability Board, and the Director of State Courts to include in their ongoing training programs a discussion of the changes in law made by this bill and to offer the training to judges, attorneys, election officials, employees of DOC, and the public.\n\nFor further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB907,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  6.03 (1) (b) of the statutes is renumbered 6.03 (1) (b) (intro.) and 2amended to read:\nAB907,2,53\n6.03 (1) (b) (intro.)

Taylor, Harris Dodd and Miller. Referred to Committee on Judiciary.\n\nAB908,1,3\n1An Act to create 976.045 of the statutes; relating to: creating a Uniform 2Collateral Consequences of Conviction Act and granting rule-making 3authority.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nThis bill addresses the issue of collateral consequences to a conviction or finding of delinquency.  The bill defines a collateral consequence as a disqualification or a penalty, disability, or disadvantage imposed by operation of law that a person suffers as a result of being convicted of, or found delinquent for, an offense.  A collateral consequence does not include imprisonment, probation, imposition of fine, assessment, or forfeiture, or costs of prosecution.\n\nThe bill requires the Legislative Reference Bureau and the Legislative Council staff, under the direction of the Joint Review Committee on Criminal Penalties, to identify and create a list of collateral consequences that accrue under state law and administrative rules.  Under the bill, a person who is charged with or indicted for an offense must receive information about collateral consequences when he or she is charged or indicted.\n\nIf a person is convicted or adjudicated delinquent, the bill requires the sentencing court to inform the person that collateral consequences may apply as a result of the conviction or adjudication and that there may be ways to obtain relief from the collateral consequences.  The bill also requires the court to let the person know when he or she may vote and where he or she may find assistance for relief from collateral consequences from a government or nonprofit agency.  Under the bill, if a court fails to provide this information to a person, or if the person does not receive information about collateral consequences when he or she is charged or indicted, that is not grounds to invalidate a plea or a conviction or adjudication of delinquency or grounds for money damages or a claim for relief from any collateral consequence.\n\nUnder the bill, a conviction or adjudication of delinquency in another state has the same effect as a conviction or adjudication of delinquency in this state for an offense that has the same elements.  A pardon or vacation of a conviction or adjudication of delinquency that occurs in another state has the same effect as a pardon or vacation of a conviction or adjudication of delinquency in this state.\n\nUnder the bill, a person who has been convicted of, or adjudicated delinquent for, an offense may petition the sentencing court, at the time of sentencing, or the court for the county in which he or she lives, after sentencing, for an order of limited relief from one or more collateral consequences that relate to the person's employment, education, housing, public benefits, or occupational licensing.  If the court hearing the petition determines that granting the petition of relief would materially assist the person in obtaining employment, education, housing, public benefits, or occupational licensing and not put the public at unreasonable risk, the court may order that certain collateral consequences not apply to the person.  The court may not relieve a person of his or her duty to register as a sex offender or, if the person is eligible to apply for an occupational driver's license, reinstate driving privileges.\n\nUnder the bill, any person may petition the court for the county in which he or she lives for a certificate of restoration of rights relieving collateral consequences after three years have passed since the person's most recent conviction or adjudication of delinquency or three years have passed since the person was released from confinement, whichever occurs later.  The bill requires the court to consider several factors, including the person's criminal record and public safety, and allows the court to grant a complete or partial restoration of rights relieving collateral consequences.  In addition, the bill requires a court to issue a certificate of restoration of full rights if a person has been pardoned by a governor.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB908,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  976.045 of the statutes is created to read:\nAB908,2,4\n2976.045  Uniform Collateral Consequences of Conviction Act.

(a)  For purposes of authorizing or imposing collateral 6consequences in this state, a conviction for an offense in a court of another state or 7the United States is deemed a conviction of the offense in this state with the same 8elements.  If there is no offense in this state with the same elements, the conviction 9is deemed a conviction of the most serious offense in this state that is established by 10the elements of the offense.  A misdemeanor in the jurisdiction of conviction may not 11be deemed a felony in this state, and an offense below a misdemeanor in the 12jurisdiction of conviction may not be deemed a conviction of a crime in this state.\nAB908,8,2013\n(b)  For purposes of authorizing or imposing collateral consequences in this 14state, a juvenile adjudication in another state or the United States may not be 15deemed a felony, misdemeanor, or offense below a misdemeanor in this state, but may 16be deemed a juvenile adjudication for the juvenile violation in this state with the 17same elements in the underlying offense.  If there is no juvenile violation in this state 18with the same underlying elements, the juvenile adjudication is deemed an 19adjudication of the most serious juvenile violation in this state that is established by 20the underlying elements of the juvenile adjudication.\nAB908,8,2421\n(c)  A conviction or adjudication of delinquency that is reversed, overturned, or 22otherwise vacated by a court of competent jurisdiction of this state, another state, or 23the United States on grounds other than rehabilitation or good behavior may not 24serve as the basis for authorizing or imposing a collateral consequence in this state.\nAB908,9,3\n1(d)  A pardon issued by another state or the United States has the same effect 2for purposes of authorizing, imposing, and relieving collateral consequences in this 3state as it has in the issuing jurisdiction.\nAB908,9,184\n(e)  A conviction or adjudication of delinquency that has been expunged, sealed, 5annulled, set aside, or otherwise vacated by a court of competent jurisdiction of 6another state or the United States on grounds of rehabilitation or good behavior, or 7for which civil rights were restored pursuant to statute, has the same effect for 8purposes of authorizing, imposing, and relieving collateral consequences in this 9state as it has in the jurisdiction of conviction or adjudication, except that vacation 10or restoration of civil rights does not relieve collateral consequences applicable under 11the law of this state for which relief could not be granted under sub.

The bill defines a CDFI as an entity that is organized under the laws of this state and has been certified by the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund established under federal law (fund) as meeting certain eligibility requirements.  The bill defines a \"qualified investment\" as a loan or deposit that pays no interest of at least $10,000 that is made for a minimum of 60 months and over which the CDFI retains complete control for the duration of the investment period.\n\nA person may claim 10 percent of the person's qualified investment, if the investment is at least $10,000, but not more than $150,000, or 12 percent of the person's qualified investment, if the investment is more than $150,000, but not more than $500,000.  If the person withdraws the qualified investment from the CDFI before the end of the investment period and does not reinvest the qualified investment in another CDFI, the person must repay a portion of the credit amounts that the person received by adding the portion to the person's tax or fee liability in a subsequent year.  However, the portion that the person must repay depends on when the person withdraws the investment during the investment period.  The portion that the person must repay decreases the longer the person holds the investment during the investment period.\n\nFor further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB911,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  71.05 (6) (a) 15. of the statutes, as affected by 2015 Wisconsin Act 255, is amended to read:AB911,2,83\n71.05 (6) (a) 15.

Referred to Committee on Education.\n\nAB912,1,2\n1An Act to create 121.91 (4) (s) of the statutes; relating to: adjusting a school 2district's revenue limit for certain school safety expenditures.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nThis bill permits a school district to increase its revenue limit by an amount equal to the greater of $40,000 or $100 times the number of pupils enrolled in the district for the purpose of making certain school safety expenditures.  As a prerequisite to increasing its revenue limit for this purpose, the school board must approve and submit to the state superintendent of public instruction a school safety expenditure plan developed jointly by the school board and a local law enforcement agency.  The school safety expenditure plan must be consistent with the school district's school safety plan.  The revenue limit adjustment first applies to the calculation of the school district revenue limit in the 2016-17 school year.\n\nCurrent law generally limits the amount of revenue per pupil that a school district may receive from general school aids and property taxes in a school year to the amount of revenue allowed per pupil in the previous school year.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB912,1\n\n\n3Section \n1.  121.91 (4) (s) of the statutes is created to read:\nAB912,2,5\n1121.91 (4) (s) 1.

The limit otherwise applicable to a school district under sub. (2m) in any 7school year is increased by an amount equal to $100 times the number of pupils 8enrolled in the school district or $40,000, whichever is greater, for the purpose of 9covering compensation costs associated with providing security officers in the school 10district, purchasing safety equipment, or improving school safety.  The increase in 11the limit under this subdivision applies only if the school board and a local law 12enforcement agency have jointly developed a school safety expenditure plan, 13consistent with the school safety plan under s. 118.07 (4), that covers each school in 14the school district and that describes the manner in which the additional revenue 15shall be used, and the school board approves and submits the school safety 16expenditure plan to the state superintendent for the purpose of calculating the school 17district's revenue limit.\nAB912,2,2018\n3.  Any additional revenue received by a school district as a result of subd. 2. 19shall not be included in the base for determining the school district's limit under sub. 20(2m) for the following school year.\nAB912,2\n\n\n21Section \n2.\nInitial applicability.\nAB912,2,2322\n(1)  School safety measures; revenue limit adjustment.

Referred to Committee on Agriculture.\n\nAB913,1,6\n1An Act to amend 15.01 (4) and 227.01 (1); and to create 15.137 (7), 20.235 (1) 2(em), 39.52 and 71.05 (6) (b) 53. of the statutes; relating to: creating a program 3for reimbursing the higher education debt of small farm operators, creating an 4individual income tax deduction for certain amounts received from such a 5program, granting rule-making authority, making an appropriation, and 6providing a penalty.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nThis bill provides for establishing a program for reimbursing certain individuals who operate small farms for their higher education debt.  An individual is eligible for reimbursement if he or she graduated from an accredited public or nonprofit institution that awards associate's or baccalaureate degrees or if he or she completed a farm and industry short course offered by the University of Wisconsin System.  However, no more than 25 percent of the amount appropriated for the program in a fiscal year can be used to reimburse individuals who complete a farm and industry short course.  Debt is not eligible for reimbursement if it is reimbursed, assumed, or paid for under another program.\n\nThe bill defines \"small farm\" as a farm with annual gross cash farm income that is not less than $35,000 nor more than $500,000 or 140 percent of the maximum amount for a small farm under the typology of the economic research service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, whichever is greater.  Whether a farm qualifies as a small farm is determined at the time an individual first receives a reimbursement payment under the program.\n\nThe bill creates a five-member council in the Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection, called the Small Farm Higher Education Debt Council, which must establish the program and has rule-making power.  The council consists of the DATCP secretary or his or her designee and the chancellor of the UW-Extension or his or her designee.  The DATCP secretary appoints the following other members for three-year terms: 1) an individual who administers or participates or cooperates in programs of the Farm Service Agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture; 2) a representative of agricultural lenders; and 3) a representative of higher education loan providers or servicers.  The bill requires DATCP to provide administrative support to the council.\n\nTo be eligible for reimbursement, the council must find that an individual satisfies the above educational requirements and that an individual is a state resident whose primary occupation is to operate a small farm.  The bill defines \"operate\" as to engage in agricultural activities at a small farm and participate in the day-to-day operation of the farm.  Also, to be eligible, an individual must begin to operate a small farm no later than five years after obtaining a baccalaureate or associate's degree or completing a farm and industry short course.  In addition, the individual must intend to operate a small farm for at least five years after applying to the council for reimbursement.  An individual is not eligible for reimbursement if another individual who also operates the small farm obtains reimbursement under the program.\n\nThe bill requires the Higher Educational Aids Board to enter into agreements with individuals whom the council finds satisfy the eligibility requirements.  In addition, HEAB must find that the repayment period of each student that is reimbursed under the program does not exceed ten years, and, for a federal student loan, that the individual has entered into the standard repayment plan of the federal Department of Education.  However, HEAB may waive the foregoing requirements based on financial hardship.  In an agreement with HEAB, an individual must express his or her commitment to pursue a long-term career in farming in this state and to make a good faith effort to comply with the requirements of the program.  An agreement must also require an individual to annually submit documentation to HEAB showing that the individual continues to be a state resident whose primary occupation is to operate a small farm and that in the preceding year he or she has made all required payments on outstanding higher education debt.  An agreement must also require an individual to notify HEAB within 60 days if he or she ceases to be a state resident or his or her primary occupation ceases to be the operation of a small farm.  Except as described below, an agreement and the payments terminate if an individual ceases to be a state resident or ceases to have as a primary occupation the operation of a small farm.  The bill provides that an individual whose agreement terminates is liable to HEAB for a specified portion of the individual's most recent annual payment.\n\nThe bill requires HEAB to make five annual payments of equal amounts to individuals who satisfy the bill's requirements.  HEAB must make the first payment as soon as practicable after entering into the agreement and the subsequent payments annually thereafter after receiving the documentation required in an agreement.  The total amount of the annual payments is $30,000, which is adjusted for inflation, or the total amount of an individual's outstanding higher education debt, whichever is less.  The bill appropriates the following maximum amounts for the program:  in fiscal year 2016-17, $60,000; in fiscal year 2017-18, $120,000; in fiscal year 2018-19, $180,000; in fiscal year 2019-20, $240,000; and in fiscal year 2020-21 and each fiscal year thereafter, $300,000.  The Department of Administration must adjust the foregoing amounts based on inflation.\n\nThe bill creates a penalty for individuals who intentionally provide false information to HEAB or the council, which is a civil forfeiture of no more than $500.  In addition, if an individual with whom HEAB has entered into an agreement intentionally provides false information or fails to notify HEAB that he or she ceases to be a state resident or ceases to operate a small farm as his or her primary occupation, the agreement terminates and the individual is liable to HEAB for the total amount of payments he or she has received together with 10 percent annual interest.  If funding is available due to agreement terminations or because the maximum amounts described above have not been exceeded in a fiscal year, the council may advise HEAB of other individuals who are eligible for reimbursement payments and, based on the amount of available funding, HEAB may limit the total amount of annual payments to those individuals.  If funding is not available to make payments to all eligible individuals who apply for reimbursement, the council must give priority to applicants in specified categories.\n\nThe bill allows certain individuals with whom HEAB has entered into agreements to remain eligible for payments despite ceasing to be state residents or ceasing to have as a primary occupation the operation of small farms.  The bill requires HEAB to consult with the council and promulgate rules allowing such individuals to remain eligible if the ineligibility is due to circumstances beyond their control, and those circumstances must include deployment in the United States armed forces or national guard.  The rules must provide for suspending the payments during ineligibility and reinstituting the payments when an individual is a state resident or has as a primary occupation the operation of a small farm.\n\nThe bill also creates an individual income tax subtract modification (deduction) for payments made to an individual under the bill.  The deduction first applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2015.\n\nThe bill requires the Legislative Audit Bureau to evaluate the effectiveness of the program in achieving the purpose of the program, which the bill specifies as to recruit and retain new Wisconsin farmers of diverse backgrounds who have completed postsecondary education, regardless of field of study, previous state residency, or background in agriculture.  The bill also specifies that the purpose is to sustain the state's small and midsize family farms while fostering innovation in sustainable best practices.  Employment of sustainable best practices is one of the categories for the council to prioritize applicants if sufficient funding is not available.  No later than July 1, 2023, and every ten years thereafter, the Legislative Audit Bureau must submit a report to the legislature regarding the evaluation.  The report must include the bureau's recommendations on terminating, continuing, revising, or expanding the program, including any funding recommendations.\n\nBecause this bill relates to an exemption from state or local taxes, it may be referred to the Joint Survey Committee on Tax Exemptions for a report to be printed as an appendix to the bill.\n\nFor further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB913,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  15.01 (4) of the statutes, as affected by 2015 Wisconsin Act 55, is 2amended to read:\nAB913,4,103\n15.01 (4)  \"Council\" means a part-time body appointed to function on a 4continuing basis for the study, and recommendation of solutions and policy 5alternatives, of the problems arising in a specified functional area of state 6government, except the council on physical disabilities has the powers and duties 7specified in s. 46.29 (1) and (2), the state council on alcohol and other drug abuse has 8the powers and duties specified in s. 14.24, the small farm higher education debt 9council has the powers and duties specified in s. 39.52 (3) and (9), and the electronic 10recording council has the powers and duties specified in s. 706.25 (4).\nAB913,2\n\n\n11Section \n2.  15.137 (7) of the statutes is created to read:\nAB913,4,1712\n15.137 (7)  Small farm higher education debt council.

(1)  Definitions.

The legislature finds that farming is central to this state's 10traditions and economy and essential for feeding residents of this state and beyond.  11The legislature also finds that as the population of farmers ages, this state faces a 12challenge recruiting and retaining new farmers.  The legislature believes that higher 13education debt is a significant barrier for new farmers who work towards economic 14viability during the early years of their careers.  The legislature therefore finds it in 15the best interest of the state to establish a program to provide financial assistance 16to new farmers carrying student debt in their first years of farming in exchange for 17a commitment to farming in this state.  The purpose of the program is to recruit and 18retain new Wisconsin farmers of diverse backgrounds who have completed 19postsecondary education, regardless of field of study, previous state residency, or 20background in agriculture, and to sustain this state's small and midsize family farms 21while fostering innovation in sustainable best practices.\nAB913,6,24\n22(3)  Reimbursement program; eligibility.

Under that statute, any person, other than the mother, who intentionally destroys the life of an unborn child is guilty of a Class H felony.  \"Unborn child\" is defined as a human being from the time of conception until born alive.  Any person, other than the mother, who intentionally destroys the life of an unborn quick child or causes the mother's death by an act done with intent to destroy the life of an unborn child is guilty of a Class E felony.\n\nNone of these penalties apply to a therapeutic abortion that is performed by a physician, is necessary, or advised by two other physicians as necessary, to save the life of the mother, and, unless an emergency prevents, is performed in a licensed maternity hospital.\n\nThe statute was cited, in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), as similar to a Texas statute that was held to violate the due process clause of the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution.  Because of the Roe v. Wade decision, a subsequent decision by a federal district court, Larkin v. McCann, 368 F. Supp. 1352 (E.D. Wis., 1974), held the statute unenforceable.\n\nThis bill repeals that statute.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB916,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  939.75 (2) (b) 1. of the statutes is amended to read:\nAB916,2,42\n939.75 (2) (b) 1.

Larson. Referred to Committee on Education.\n\nAB918,1,7\n1An Act to repeal 118.44; to amend 20.255 (2) (cu), 118.38 (1) (a) 9., 118.43 (6) 2(b) 11., 118.43 (7), 118.60 (2) (a) (intro.) and 119.23 (2) (a) (intro.); to repeal and 3recreate 118.43 (9); and to create 118.435, 118.60 (12) and 119.23 (12) of the 4statutes; relating to: terminating parental choice programs, repealing the 5achievement gap reduction program, expanding the student achievement 6guarantee program, granting rule-making authority, and making an 7appropriation.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nThis bill repeals the Achievement Gap Reduction (AGR) program created in 2015 Wisconsin Act 53, reinstates an expanded Student Achievement Guarantee in Education (SAGE) program, and phases out the Milwaukee, Racine, and statewide parental choice programs (together, choice programs).\n\nBoth the AGR and SAGE programs are categorical aid programs that provide funding to participating schools for low-income pupils enrolled in participating grades if the participating school complies with a five-year contract entered into between a school board, on behalf of the participating school, and the Department of Public Instruction (DPI).  Under the AGR program repealed in this bill, a participating grade is a grade from kindergarten to third grade that is subject to an AGR contract.  The expanded SAGE program established under this bill applies to all grades, from four-year-old kindergarten through grade 12.\n\nUnder the AGR program repealed in this bill, a school board must implement one or more of the following strategies in each class in each participating grade at each participating school:\n\n1.  Reduce the class size to 18 pupils or, if a classroom has at least two regular classroom teachers, to 30 pupils, and provide professional development on small group instruction.\n\n2.  Provide instructional coaching for teachers.\n\n3.  Provide one-to-one tutoring to pupils who struggle with reading or math. Under the expanded SAGE program created in this bill, each participating school must reduce the class size of each class in the school to 18 pupils or, if a classroom has at least two regular classroom teachers, to 30 pupils.  In addition, the school board must:\n\n(a)  Ensure that certain education and human services are available in each participating school.\n\n(b)  Ensure that a rigorous curriculum is provided in each participating school.\n\n(c)  Provide staff development and require professional staff accountability for staff in each participating school.\n\nUnder the AGR program repealed in this bill, DPI must pay to a school board under an AGR contract a per pupil amount determined by dividing the amount appropriated to the AGR program by the total number of pupils enrolled in a participating class.  Under the expanded SAGE program created in this bill, DPI must pay $2,250 for each pupil in a participating class.  Under the bill, DPI must annually adjust the per pupil payment to reflect the percentage change in the consumer price index, if that change is positive.  The repeal of the AGR takes effect immediately; the bill permits school boards to enter into contracts under the expanded SAGE program in the 2016-17 school year.\n\nAlso under this bill, beginning in the 2016-17 school year, no private school may participate in a choice program unless the school was participating in the program in the 2015-16 school year.  Also under the bill, no pupil may attend a private school under a choice program unless the pupil was attending that private school under the program in the 2015-16 school year.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB918,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  20.255 (2) (cu) of the statutes, as affected by 2015 Wisconsin Act 53, 2is amended to read:\nAB918,3,3\n120.255 (2) (cu)  Achievement gap reduction guarantee contracts.

The legislature finds that the voucher program 6established under ss. 118.60, 2013 stats., and 119.23, 2013 stats., is a failed 7experiment.  The legislature further finds that the student achievement guarantee 8in education program established under s. 118.43 has had measurable impacts on 9pupils enrolled in schools that have entered into contracts with the department 10under that section as compared to pupils who were enrolled in schools not 11participating in the program established under s. 118.43.  These impacts include 12improved reading academic growth in kindergarten, improved mathematics and 13reading academic growth from kindergarten through 3rd grade, and a positive effect 14on students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds completing high school.  15The legislature finds that the student achievement guarantee in education program 16should be expanded under this section and that state resources allocated to the 17voucher program should be redirected to the program under this section.\nAB918,4,18\n18(2)  Definitions.

For instance, under this bill, state agencies must attempt to ensure that they pay woman-owned businesses 5 percent of the total amount expended for state procurements or certain state construction projects in each fiscal year, which is identical to the requirements for minority-owned businesses.  To meet this goal, state agencies may purchase materials or services from a woman-owned business that submits a bid that is no more than 5 percent higher than the apparent low bid.  This preference is identical to the preference given to minority-owned businesses under current law.\n\nFor further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB920,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  16.75 (3m) (a) 5. of the statutes is created to read:\nAB920,2,32\n16.75 (3m) (a) 5.  \"Woman-owned business\" means a business certified by the 3department of administration under s. 16.285.\nAB920,2\n\n\n4Section \n2.  16.75 (3m) (b) 1m. of the statutes is created to read:\nAB920,2,85\n16.75 (3m) (b) 1m.

Under current law, a student admitted to elementary, middle, junior, or senior high school, a child care center, or a nursery school must, within 30 days of admission, present evidence of having completed the first immunization for each vaccine required for the student's grade and being on schedule for the remainder of the basic and booster immunization series for mumps, measles, rubella, diphtheria, whooping cough, poliomyelitis, tetanus, and any other diseases the Department of Health Services specifies by rule.  This immunization requirement is waived, however, if the student or the student's parent, guardian, or legal custodian instead submits a written statement to the school, child care center, or nursery school objecting to the immunization for reasons of health, religion, or personal conviction.  A school, child care center, or nursery school may exclude a student who does not meet the immunization requirement or does not present a waiver and is required to exclude a student who does not meet the immunization requirement or does not present a waiver if fewer than 99 percent of the students have complied with the immunization requirement or presented a waiver.  A court may issue an order directing a student to comply with the immunization requirement or present a waiver by a certain date, and if the student is not in compliance, the court may require an adult student or the parent, guardian, or legal custodian of a minor student to pay a forfeiture.  This bill eliminates personal conviction as a reason for a waiver of the immunization requirement.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB924,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  252.04 (3) of the statutes is amended to read:\nAB924,2,82\n252.04 (3)  The immunization requirement is waived if the student, if an adult, 3or the student's parent, guardian, or legal custodian submits a written statement to 4the school, child care center, or nursery school objecting to the immunization for 5reasons of health, or religion, or personal conviction.  At the time any school, child 6care center, or nursery school notifies a student, parent, guardian, or legal custodian 7of the immunization requirements, it shall inform the person in writing of the 8person's right to a waiver under this subsection.\nAB924,2,99\n(End)\n            Down\r\n        Down\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n"

Taylor, cosponsored by Senators Carpenter, Lassa, Hansen, L. Taylor, Wirch, C. Larson, Erpenbach and Harris Dodd. Referred to Committee on Veterans and Military Affairs.\n\nAB925,1,4\n1An Act to amend 111.39 (4) (d) and 814.04 (intro.); and to create 111.39 (5) (d), 2111.397 and 893.995 of the statutes; \nrelating to: authorizing the circuit court 3to order a person who engages in discrimination in employment on the basis of 4military service to pay compensatory and punitive damages.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nThis bill permits the Department of Workforce Development or a person who has been discriminated against on the basis of military service to bring an action in circuit court to recover compensatory and punitive damages caused by the act of discrimination, plus reasonable costs and attorney fees incurred in the action, after the completion of all administrative proceedings before DWD and the Labor and Industry Review Commission concerning the violation.  Those damages are in addition to any back pay or other amounts awarded in the administrative proceeding.  The bill, however, does not permit an action for damages to be brought against any local governmental unit or against any employer employing fewer than 15 individuals.\n\nUnder the bill, if the circuit court finds that a defendant has discriminated on the basis of military service, the circuit court must order the defendant to pay to the person discriminated against compensatory and punitive damages in an amount that the circuit court finds appropriate, subject to the following limitations:\n\n1.  If the defendant employs 100 or fewer employees, $50,000.\n\n2.  If the defendant employs more than 100 but fewer than 201 employees, $100,000.\n\n3.  If the defendant employs more than 200 but fewer than 501 employees, $200,000.\n\n4.  If the defendant employs more than 500 employees, $300,000.\n\nUnder current law, employment discrimination on the basis of military service includes discriminating against an individual because the individual is or applies to be a member of the U.S. armed forces, the state defense force, the national guard of any state, or any reserve component of the U.S. armed forces or because the individual performs, has performed, applies to perform, or has an obligation to perform military service.  Employment discrimination on the basis of military service, however, does not include refusing to hire, employ, or license an individual or barring or terminating an individual from employment or licensure because the individual has been less than honorably discharged from military service and the circumstances of the discharge substantially relate to the circumstances of the particular job or licensed activity.\n\nUnder current law, a person alleging discrimination in employment on the basis of military service may file a complaint with DWD seeking action that will effectuate the purpose of the employment discrimination law, including reinstating the complainant, providing back pay, and paying costs and attorney fees.  Current law, however, does not authorize DWD to award compensatory or punitive damages to a complainant.\n\nFor further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB925,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  111.39 (4) (d) of the statutes is amended to read:\nAB925,3,72\n111.39 (4) (d)  The department shall serve a certified copy of the findings and 3order on the respondent, the order to have the same force as other orders of the 4department and be enforced as provided in s. 103.005.

If the examiner finds that the respondent has not engaged in discrimination, 7unfair honesty testing, or unfair genetic testing as alleged in the complaint, the 8department shall serve a certified copy of the examiner's findings on the 9complainant, together with an order dismissing the complaint.  If the examiner finds 10that the respondent has engaged in discrimination on the basis of military service 1as alleged in the complaint, the department shall serve a certified copy of the 2examiner's findings on the complainant, together with a notice advising the 3complainant that after the completion of all administrative proceedings under this 4section he or she may bring an action as provided in s. 111.397 (1) (a) to recover 5compensatory and punitive damages as provided in s. 111.397 (2) (a) and advising the 6complainant of the time under s. 111.397 (1) (b) within which the action must be 7commenced or be barred.\nAB925,2\n\n\n8Section \n2.  111.39 (5) (d) of the statutes is created to read:\nAB925,3,169\n111.39 (5) (d)  If the commission affirms a finding that the respondent has 10engaged in discrimination on the basis of military service as alleged in the complaint, 11the commission shall serve a certified copy of the commission's decision on the 12complainant, together with a notice advising the complainant that after the 13completion of all administrative proceedings under this section he or she may bring 14an action as provided in s. 111.397 (1) (a) to recover compensatory and punitive 15damages as provided in s. 111.397 (2) (a) and advising the complainant of the time 16under s. 111.397 (1) (b) within which the action must be commenced or be barred.\nAB925,3\n\n\n17Section \n3.  111.397 of the statutes is created to read:\nAB925,4,4\n18111.397  Civil action.

(a) 12is filed, the court shall consolidate the proceeding for judicial review and the action 13under par. (a).\nAB925,4,22\n14(2) (a)  Subject to pars. (b) and (c), in an action under sub. (1) (a), the circuit court 15shall order the defendant to pay to the person discriminated against compensatory 16damages, and punitive damages under s. 895.043, in an amount that the circuit court 17or jury finds appropriate, plus reasonable costs and attorney fees incurred in the 18action.  Those damages are in addition to any back pay or other amounts awarded 19under s. 111.39.  The sum of the amount of compensatory damages for future 20economic losses and for pain and suffering, emotional distress, mental anguish, loss 21of enjoyment of life, and other noneconomic losses and the amount of punitive 22damages that a circuit court may order may not exceed the following:\nAB925,4,2523\n1.

An exempt person may maintain his or her professional title but may not engage in the relevant practice.  Also, under the bill, an exempt person must pay only one-half of the applicable renewal fee to maintain his or her professional credential.\n\nFor further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB934,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  443.015 (1m) of the statutes is created to read:\nAB934,2,82\n443.015 (1m) (a)  Any rules a section of the examining board promulgates under 3sub.

Licenses, permits, and certificates of certification or registration issued by DSPS, an examining board, or an affiliated credentialing board with respect to various professions, including cosmetology, accounting, architecture, boxing, mixed martial arts, and health professions (professional credentials).\n\n2.  Licenses, permits, certificates, registrations, or other approvals issued by DSPS with respect to trades (occupational licenses).\n\nSpecifically, this bill requires that any rules promulgated by DSPS that define uniform procedures for the following must conform with rules related to professional credentials: receiving, filing, and investigating complaints against holders of occupational licenses; commencing disciplinary proceedings against holders of occupational licenses; and conducting hearings on matters relating to occupational licenses.\n\nThis bill also provides that many laws that apply to professional credentials also apply to occupational licenses, including laws that do all of the following:\n\n1.  Govern how and when an application for an initial professional credential or a renewal is granted or denied.\n\n2.  Prescribe standards and procedures for how a person may file a complaint against a professional credential holder.\n\n3.  Set forth standards and procedures for conducting investigations, commencing disciplinary proceedings, holding hearings, and making findings regarding violations of laws and rules governing professional credential holders.\n\n4.  Prescribe the process and procedure for issuing administrative warnings to professional credential holders, reprimanding professional credential holders, and denying, limiting, suspending, and revoking professional credentials.\n\n5.  Set forth certain rights and obligations of professional credential holders.\n\nMultifamily Dwelling Code\n\nThe bill repeals the statutes, and the authority of DSPS to promulgate rules, that establish standards for the construction of multifamily dwellings and their components.  Those statutes and rules are commonly known as the multifamily dwelling code.\n\nUnder current law, a county, city, village, or town (municipality) is prohibited from enforcing any ordinance that does not comply with the multifamily dwelling code, except with respect to a preexisting stricter sprinkler ordinance that meets certain requirements.  The bill repeals the multifamily dwelling code, including the exception for preexisting stricter sprinkler ordinances, but retains certain powers of DSPS which are incorporated into the provisions that regulate public buildings and buildings that are places of employment (commercial building code).\n\nUnder the bill, a multifamily dwelling is subject to the commercial building code if the multifamily dwelling is a \"public building,\" which current law defines to include a building used by the public or by three or more tenants for lodging or occupancy.\n\nCommercial Building Code\n\nThe bill requires DSPS to promulgate rules establishing uniform procedures for municipalities to administer the commercial building code and prohibits municipalities from enacting or enforcing an ordinance that does not strictly conform to the rules.  Under the bill, administration includes the process an owner must follow when applying for a permit for constructing, altering, or adding to a public building or a building that is a place of employment.\n\nBuilding Inspector Review Board\n\nThe bill eliminates the Building Inspector Review Board and transfers most of the board's authority over building inspectors to DSPS.  Under the bill, DSPS, rather than the board, receives and reviews complaints regarding building inspectors and has the authority to revoke a building inspector's certification.  The bill also provides that DSPS's authority is not limited to revocation.  Under the bill, DSPS also may reprimand a building inspector or deny, limit, suspend, or revoke a building inspector's certification.\n\nThe bill eliminates, rather than transfers to DSPS, the authority of the board to modify or reverse erroneous decisions of a building inspector.  The bill also eliminates procedures related to how complaints are received, processed, and kept confidential that are specific to complaints against building inspectors.\n\nPenalties for Violations of Law\n\nThe bill increases the monetary penalties for certain violations of laws and rules that regulate various aspects of industry, buildings, and safety, including the following:  safe storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia; safety glazing material used in hazardous locations; construction standards and inspection procedures for one-family and two-family dwellings; manufacture and installation of modular homes; installation, repair, and maintenance of electrical wiring; manufacture, distribution, and sale of manufactured homes and mobile homes; and installation and operation of elevators, escalators, and other conveyances.  The bill also clarifies that certain violations constitute a separate offense for each day of continued violation and creates a penalty for violations by a contractor of notice requirements related to construction or remodeling of a dwelling.\n\nSafety Glazing Material in Hazardous Locations\n\nThe bill repeals existing statutory requirements related to labeling, installing, and selling safety glazing material located or to be located in hazardous locations.  Under the bill, DSPS must promulgate rules regulating safety glazing material manufactured, distributed, imported, sold, or installed for use in a hazardous location.\n\nAging Schools Program\n\nThe bill repeals an outdated requirement under the aging schools program that DSPS inspect all public schools constructed prior to January 1, 1950, for compliance with certain safety and building requirements.\n\nList of Variances under the Historic Building Code\n\nThe bill eliminates the requirement that DSPS maintain a list of all variances from the historic building code granted to owners of qualified historic buildings.  Under current law, DSPS may create an historic building code to provide alternative standards for the preservation or restoration of buildings or structures designated as historic buildings, and DSPS may grant variances to any rules or alternative rules if the owner demonstrates that an alternative proposed by the owner accomplishes the same purpose.  Under the bill, DSPS is not required to maintain a list of all variances DSPS grants.\n\nList of Licensed Retail Suppliers of Liquefied Petroleum Gas\n\nThe bill eliminates the requirement that DSPS publish an annual list of all retail suppliers licensed by DSPS to distribute liquefied petroleum gas.\n\nFrequency of Review of Municipal Construction Site Erosion Control Programs\n\nThe bill reduces the frequency with which DSPS must issue a written determination regarding whether a municipality's construction site erosion control program is in compliance with state standards.  Under current law, if a municipality elects to exercise jurisdiction over the construction and inspection of new dwellings, DSPS must periodically review the municipality's ordinances related to construction site erosion control for compliance with state standards.  As part of the review, DSPS must perform an audit of the municipality's construction site erosion control program and make a written determination regarding whether the municipality is in compliance.  The bill changes the frequency of the DSPS written determination from three years to five years.\n\nAlternative Dispute Resolution for Manufactured Housing Industry Disputes\n\nThe bill eliminates the requirement that DSPS establish by rule an alternative dispute resolution program for disputes concerning defects in or installation of manufactured homes.  Under current law, the ADR program must provide for the timely, nonjudicial resolution of disputes among manufacturers, salespersons, dealers, and installers of manufactured homes if those disputes are reported to DSPS within one year of the date on which a manufactured home is installed.\n\nManufactured Home Construction and Safety Reports\n\nThe bill requires DSPS to prepare and submit all reports required under federal law related to manufactured home construction and safety.  Under current law, manufactured homes must be manufactured, assembled, distributed, and sold in compliance with federal statutes and regulations.  Those federal laws require reporting by states related to manufactured home construction and safety, and the bill requires DSPS to prepare and submit all required reports.\n\nTemporary Revocable Permits for Master and Journeyman Plumbers\n\nThe bill eliminates the authority of DSPS to issue temporary revocable permits to master and journeyman plumbers pending an examination.  The bill also eliminates the authority of DSPS to promulgate rules governing the issuance of those permits.\n\nSeptic Tank Installers\n\nThe bill eliminates references under current law to \"septic tank installers\" in requirements related to installation of private on-site wastewater treatment systems.\n\nDefinition of Public Swimming Pools\n\nThe bill changes the definition of public swimming pool to exclude an inflated mobile structure, a swim pond, or an individual therapeutic pod, tub, or bath.  Under current law, DSPS must review and approve any plans for the construction, alteration, or reconstruction of a public swimming pool, and no one may maintain, manage, or operate a public swimming pool unless DSPS has approved the plans and the public swimming pool conforms to those plans.\n            Down\r\n        Down\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Up\r\n        Up\r\n\nReorganization of Plumbing, Fire Protection Systems, and Swimming Pool Plan Review Law\n\nThe bill reorganizes the statutes so that the laws related to plumbing, fire protection systems, and swimming pool plan review are located in a separate subchapter within the chapter that covers regulation of industry, buildings, and safety.\n\nMandatory Meeting Requirements\n\nThe bill eliminates mandatory annual and semiannual meeting requirements of the examining boards, affiliated credentialing boards, and other boards and councils under DSPS, except for the Medical Examining Board, which is required to meet 12 times each year.  Instead, under the bill, those boards and councils are generally required to meet on the call of the chairperson or a majority of the members of the board or council.\n\nAdministrative Warnings\n\nThe bill provides that DSPS and the examining boards, affiliated credentialing boards, and other boards under DSPS that have disciplinary authority over professional credential holders may issue an administrative warning regardless of whether the minor violation for which the administrative warning is issued is a first occurrence for the credential holder.  Under current law, an administrative warning may be issued only if DSPS or the relevant board finds that the professional credential holder's violation is a first occurrence of a minor violation.\n\nCompounded Interest Charged for Costs of Disciplinary Proceedings\n\nThe bill provides that the interest charged for costs of disciplinary proceedings is compounded annually.  Under current law, DSPS and the examining boards, affiliated credentialing boards, and other boards under DSPS that have disciplinary authority over professional credential holders may charge the credential holder for all or a part of the costs of a disciplinary proceeding involving that credential holder.  Interest upon those costs accrues at the rate of 12 percent annually.\n\nRegistration of Licensed Medical Professionals\n\nThe bill removes the specific time by which a licensed physician or other credentialed medical professional must register with the Medical Examining Board.  Under current law, each licensed physician or other credentialed medical professional must register with the board by November 1 of each odd-numbered year following initial licensure.  Under the bill, the board determines the time and manner of registration.\n\nJurisprudence Examination for Funeral Directors\n\nThe bill requires a jurisprudence examination for applicants for licensure as a funeral director that tests an applicant's knowledge of state law relating to funeral directing.  The bill does not otherwise affect current examination requirements.\n\nElimination of Degree Requirement for Sitting for Certain Exams\n\nThe bill eliminates certain prerequisite degree requirements to sit for an examination for licensure by the Marriage and Family Therapy, Professional Counseling, and Social Work Examining Board.

Referred to Committee on Judiciary.\n\nAB936,1,4\n1An Act to amend 343.21 (1) (j), 345.47 (1) (b), 800.09 (1g), 800.095 (1) (a) (intro.), 2800.095 (1) (a) 3. and 800.095 (1) (a) 4.; and to create 345.47 (1) (bm) of the 3statutes; relating to: suspension of operating privilege for failure to pay 4certain monetary judgments.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nThis bill limits a court's authority to suspend the operating privilege of a person for failure to pay a monetary judgment.\n\nCurrent law permits a court to suspend for up to two years the operating privilege of an person who has failed to pay a monetary judgment entered against the person for a civil violation.  This bill reduces the maximum time for which the operating privilege may be suspended by a court under these circumstances from two years to three months.  The bill also prohibits a court from suspending, for failure to pay a monetary judgment entered against a person for a civil violation, the operating privilege of a person who is less than 18 years of age and who is not currently and has not previously been licensed in this or another state.\n\nAlso under current law, the Department of Transportation collects a $50 fee for reinstatement of an operating privilege previously revoked or suspended.  Under this bill, no fee may be collected for the reinstatement of an operating privilege suspended for failure to pay a monetary judgment for a civil violation.\n\nCurrent law requires a court to inform a defendant, both orally and in writing, of certain information regarding restitution, forfeiture, and the potential consequences of failure to pay a monetary judgment entered against a person for a civil violation, including imprisonment or license suspension.  Current law also requires a court to inform a defendant, orally and in writing, that the defendant should notify the court if he or she is unable to pay the judgment because of poverty, and that he or she may be allowed to perform community service in lieu of payment of the judgment.  This bill adds a requirement that a court post in each courtroom the information regarding the possibility of community service in lieu of payment for those unable to pay.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB936,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  343.21 (1) (j) of the statutes is amended to read:\nAB936,2,42\n343.21 (1) (j)  For reinstatement of an operating privilege previously revoked 3or suspended, $50.  No fee shall be collected for the reinstatement of an operating 4privilege suspended under s. 345.47 (1) (b).\nAB936,2\n\n\n5Section \n2.  345.47 (1) (b) of the statutes is amended to read:\nAB936,3,26\n345.47 (1) (b)  In lieu of imprisonment and in addition to any other suspension 7or revocation, that, except as provided in par. (bm), the defendant's operating 8privilege be suspended.  The operating privilege shall be suspended for 30 days or 9until the person pays the forfeiture, plus costs, fees, and surcharges imposed under 10ch. 814, but not to exceed  2 years 3 months.  If the defendant has notified the court 11that he or she is unable to pay the judgment because of poverty, and if the court, using 12the criteria in s. 814.29 (1) (d), determines that the defendant is unable to pay the 13judgment because of poverty, the court may not suspend the defendant's operating 14privilege without first providing the defendant with an opportunity to pay the 15judgment in installments, taking into account the defendant's income.  Suspension 16under this paragraph shall not affect the power of the court to suspend or revoke 17under s. 343.30 or the power of the secretary to suspend or revoke the operating 1privilege.  This paragraph does not apply if the judgment was entered solely for 2violation of an ordinance unrelated to the violator's operation of a motor vehicle.\nAB936,3\n\n\n3Section \n3.  345.47 (1) (bm) of the statutes is created to read:\nAB936,3,64\n345.47 (1) (bm)  The operating privilege of a person who is less than 18 years 5of age and who is not currently and has not previously been licensed in this or another 6state may not be suspended under par. (b).\nAB936,4\n\n\n7Section \n4.  800.09 (1g) of the statutes is amended to read:\nAB936,4,28\n800.09 (1g)  The court may defer payment of any judgment or provide for 9installment payments.  At the time that the judgment is rendered, the court shall 10inform the defendant, orally and in writing, of the date by which restitution and the 11payment of the forfeiture, plus costs, fees, and surcharges imposed under ch. 814, 12must be made, and of the possible consequences of failure to do so in timely fashion, 13including imprisonment, as provided in s. 800.095, or suspension of the defendant's 14motor vehicle operating privilege, as provided in sub. (1b) (c), if applicable.  In 15addition, the court shall post a notice in a conspicuous place in each courtroom and 16inform the defendant, orally and in writing, that the defendant should notify the 17court if he or she is unable to pay the judgment because of poverty, as that term is 18used in s. 814.29 (1) (d), and that he or she may request community service in lieu 19of payment of the judgment.  If the defendant is not present, the court shall ensure 20that the information is sent to the defendant by mail.  If the defendant is present and 21the court, using the criteria in s. 814.29 (1) (d), determines that the defendant is 22unable to pay the judgment because of poverty, the court shall provide the defendant 23with an opportunity to pay the judgment in installments, taking into account the 24defendant's income, or to perform community service in lieu of payment of the 1judgment.  In 1st class cities, all of the written information required by this 2subsection shall be printed in English and Spanish and provided to each defendant.\nAB936,5\n\n\n3Section \n5.  800.095 (1) (a) (intro.) of the statutes is amended to read:\nAB936,4,94\n800.095 (1) (a) (intro.)  Suspension of the defendant's operating privilege until 5the defendant pays the judgment, but not to exceed  2 years 3 months.  The operating 6privilege of a person who is less than 18 years of age and who is not currently and 7has not previously been licensed in this or another state may not be suspended under 8this paragraph.  If the court orders suspension under this paragraph, all of the 9following apply:\nAB936,6\n\n\n10Section \n6.  800.095 (1) (a) 3. of the statutes is amended to read:\nAB936,4,1311\n800.095 (1) (a) 3.  If the judgment remains unpaid at the end of the  2-year 123-month suspension, the court may not order a further suspension of operating 13privileges in relation to the outstanding judgment.\nAB936,7\n\n\n14Section \n7.  800.095 (1) (a) 4. of the statutes is amended to read:\nAB936,4,1715\n800.095 (1) (a) 4.  Serving the complete  2-year 3-month suspension of the 16defendant's operating privilege does not relieve the defendant of the responsibility 17to pay the judgment.\nAB936,4,1818\n(End)\n            Down\r\n        Down\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n"

Taylor. Referred to Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety.\n\nAB937,1,4\n1An Act to amend 66.0511 (title), 165.85 (4) (a) 1. and 814.04 (intro.); and to 2create 15.257 (3), 66.0511 (2m), 165.10, 165.842, 165.847, 893.995 and 895.44 3of the statutes; relating to: racial profiling and other discriminatory policing 4practices and granting rule-making authority.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nThis bill addresses racial profiling and other discriminatory policing practices as a violation of an individual's rights and allows for the Department of Justice (DOJ) and an individual to pursue a civil action if an individual's civil rights are violated.\n\nConstitutional rights and civil actions\n\nArticle I of the Wisconsin Constitution guarantees certain rights, including the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; to freedom of speech, assembly, and religion; to petition the government; to a trial by jury; to a remedy for all wrongs; to be treated with fairness, dignity, and respect if a crime victim; to be secure from unreasonable searches and seizures; to keep and bear arms; and to fish, hunt, trap, and take game.  Article I also guarantees a criminal defendant the rights to counsel, to confront his or her accusers, to a speedy and public trial, to due process of law, to reasonable bail, and to habeas corpus and prohibits double jeopardy, self-incrimination, and cruel and unusual punishment.  In addition, Article I prohibits ex post facto laws, laws impairing the obligation of contract, and the taking of property for public use without just compensation (Article I rights).\n\nThis bill permits a person to bring a civil action in circuit court for violation of his or her Article I rights against any person that caused the injury, including the state or any political subdivision of the state, within six years after the alleged Article I rights violation.  Under the bill, the circuit court may issue an injunction or restraining order and may order any other relief the court considers appropriate, including compensatory and punitive damages and reasonable costs, expert witness fees, and attorney fees.  This civil action remedy is in addition to any other remedy under current law.\n\nThe bill also creates a council within DOJ that is charged with investigating claims of racial profiling and other discriminatory policing practices.  Under the bill, racial profiling and other discriminatory practices include any action taken by a law enforcement officer, against or toward an individual that relies, to any degree, on the individual's actual or perceived race, color, ethnicity, religion, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, immigration or citizenship status, language spoken, disability or illness, housing status, occupation or employment status, or socioeconomic status.  However, it is not racial profiling or a discriminatory policing practice for a law enforcement officer to rely on any of those factors if the factor links the individual to a specific, reliable description of an individual suspected of committing a crime.\n\nUnder the bill, if the council finds probable cause that an act of racial profiling or other discriminatory policing practice occurred, it may refer the matter to the law enforcement agency that employs the offending officer for disciplinary action against the officer and may refer the matter to DOJ for civil action as a violation of the individual's Article I rights.  The bill authorizes DOJ to bring an action in court to obtain equitable or injunctive relief in order to protect the civil rights of individuals.\n\ndata collection\n\nUnder current law, a law enforcement agency must collect information concerning each person whom the law enforcement agency arrests or takes into custody if the person has committed certain offenses or is a fugitive from justice.  The information that the law enforcement agency must collect includes the person's fingerprints, photographs of the person's face and profile, and other available identifying data.  The information collected must be forwarded to DOJ, which maintains the information for various law enforcement and reporting purposes.\n\nThe bill requires a law enforcement agency to collect the following information concerning motor vehicle stops made on or after January 1, 2017:  1) the name, address, gender, and race of the operator of the motor vehicle, with the officer subjectively determining the person's race as being Caucasian, African American, Hispanic, American Indian or Alaska Native, or Asian or Pacific Islander; 2) the reason for the motor vehicle stop; 3) the make and year of the motor vehicle; 4) the date, time, and location of the motor vehicle stop; 5) whether or not a law enforcement officer conducted a search of the motor vehicle, the operator, or any passenger and, if so, whether the search was with consent or by other means; 6) the name, address, gender, and race of any person searched; and 7) the name and badge number of the officer making the motor vehicle stop.\n\nThe information that is collected under the bill concerning motor vehicle stops is not subject to inspection or copying as a public record.  The information, however, must be forwarded to DOJ, which must then compile and analyze it, along with any other relevant information, to determine, both for the state as a whole and for each law enforcement agency, whether the number of stops and searches involving motor vehicles operated or occupied by members of a racial minority are disproportionate compared to the number of stops and searches involving motor vehicles operated or occupied solely by persons who are not members of a racial minority.\n\nThe determination of whether the number of stops and searches involving racial minorities is disproportionate must be based on an estimate of the population and characteristics of all persons traveling on state highways, on an estimate of the populations and characteristics of persons traveling on state highways who are violating a law or ordinance, or on some other relevant population estimate.\n\nIf DOJ finds that the number of stops and searches involving racial minorities is disproportionate compared to the number of stops and searches involving nonminorities, DOJ must then determine whether that disproportion is the result of racial profiling, racial stereotyping, or other race-based discrimination or selective enforcement.  Under the bill, DOJ must prepare an annual report that summarizes the information submitted to it by law enforcement agencies and that describes the methods and conclusions of its analysis of the information.\n\nlaw enforcement training and standards\n\nUnder current law, no person may be appointed as a law enforcement officer unless the person has been certified by the Law Enforcement Standards Board (LESB) after completing a training program approved by LESB.  Currently, LESB must establish minimum educational and training standards for law enforcement officers and minimum curriculum requirements for law enforcement officer training programs.  The bill requires LESB to ensure that its law enforcement training program include instruction designed to prevent the use of race, racial profiling, racial stereotyping, or other race-based discrimination or selection as a basis for detaining, searching, or arresting a person or for otherwise treating a person differently from persons of other races.\n\nUnder current law, state and local law enforcement agencies must have a written policy or standard regulating the use of force by law enforcement officers in the performance of their duties.

Referred to Committee on Ways and Means.\n\nAB940,1,4\n1An Act to amend 66.1105 (4) (gm) 4. c. and 66.1105 (4) (h) 2. of the statutes; 2relating to: calculating the allowable number of amendments that a 3municipality may make to a tax incremental district's project plan and creating 4an exception to certain requirements in the amendment of such a district's plan.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nThis bill changes the method of calculating the maximum number of project plan amendments to a tax incremental financing district's (TID's) project plan and creates an exception to the 12 percent test.  Generally under current law, a planning commission may amend a TID's project plan to add or subtract territory from a TID a maximum of four times during the TID's life.  A single amendment, which both adds and subtracts territory, is counted as one amendment of a project plan.\n\nUnder this bill, an amendment to a project plan that subtracts territory does not count toward the maximum number of allowable amendments to a project plan.  As under current law, a single amendment which both adds and subtracts territory is still counted as one amendment.\n\nCurrently, before a TID may be created or its project plan amended, the city or village must adopt a resolution containing a finding that the equalized value of taxable property of the TID plus the value increment of all existing TIDs does not exceed 12 percent of the total equalized value of taxable property in the city or village (the \"12 percent test\"), subject to one general exception.  Under the exception, a city or village may simultaneously create a new TID and subtract territory from an existing TID without adopting a resolution containing the 12 percent test if the city or village demonstrates to DOR that the value of the territory that is subtracted at least equals the amount that DOR believes is necessary to ensure that, when the new TID is created, the 12 percent test is met.  The city or village must also certify to DOR that no other TID created under this exception currently exists in the city or village.\n\nUnder this bill, an amendment to a project plan which only subtracts territory from a TID is not subject to the 12 percent test.\n\nFor further information see the local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB940,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  66.1105 (4) (gm) 4. c. of the statutes is amended to read:\nAB940,2,132\n66.1105 (4) (gm) 4. c.

An amendment to a project plan which only 4subtracts territory, as described under this subdivision, is not subject to the 12 5percent limit findings requirement under par. (gm) 4. c.

The statutory definition includes 21 retailers who are so classified, including variety stores, dairy product stores, gasoline service stations, eating places, drinking places, and hotels and motels.\n\nCurrently, a number of cities and villages are authorized to enact an ordinance or adopt a resolution to become a premier resort area notwithstanding the fact that none of these cities or villages meet the 40 percent requirement.  As is the case with the villages of Sister Bay, Ephraim, and Stockholm, and the city of Rhinelander, the premier resort area tax may not take effect in Prescott unless it is approved in a referendum of the electors.\n\nA premier resort area may impose a tax at a rate of 0.5 percent of the gross receipts from the sale, lease, or rental of goods or services that are subject to the general sales and use tax and are sold by tourism-related retailers.  The proceeds of the tax may be used only to pay for infrastructure expenses within the jurisdiction of the premier resort area.  The definition of \"infrastructure expenses\" includes the costs of purchasing, constructing, or improving parking lots; transportation facilities, including roads and bridges; sewer and water facilities; recreational facilities; exposition center facilities; fire fighting equipment; and police vehicles.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB941,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  66.1113 (2) (a) of the statutes, as affected by 2015 Wisconsin Act 55, 2is amended to read:\nAB941,2,83\n66.1113 (2) (a)  The governing body of a political subdivision, by a two-thirds 4vote of the members of the governing body who are present when the vote is taken, 5may enact an ordinance or adopt a resolution declaring itself to be a premier resort 6area if, except as provided in pars.

Referred to Committee on Insurance.\n\nAB942,1,2\n1An Act to amend 194.41 (1); and to create 194.01 (12m) of the statutes; 2relating to: insurance requirements for vehicle rental companies.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nThis bill specifies the circumstances under which a vehicle rental company is subject to the minimum liability insurance policy limits applicable for motor carriers, rather than the standard policy limits applicable to most vehicles.\n\nCurrent law provisions relating to motor vehicle insurance requirements require a lessor or rental company to have on file with the Department of Transportation proof of motor vehicle liability insurance as a prerequisite to renting or leasing a motor vehicle for compensation.  The minimum policy limits required for this insurance are, for each accident, $25,000 for bodily injury or death to one person and $50,000 for bodily injury or death to more than one person, as well as $10,000 for property damage.  For purposes of these provisions, a \"lessor\" and a \"rental company\" are defined as a person who, for compensation, leases or rents, respectively, a motor vehicle to a lessee or renter to be operated by or with the consent of the lessee or renter or who acquires a contract for the leasing or renting of a motor vehicle from another person.\n\nCurrent law provisions relating to motor carriers also require a rental company to have on file with DOT proof of motor vehicle liability insurance as a prerequisite to registering a motor vehicle or obtaining a motor carrier operating permit.  The minimum policy limit required for this insurance is generally an amount specified under federal law (generally $750,000), but for a vehicle with a gross weight of not more than 10,000 pounds that is not transporting hazardous materials it is $300,000.  Current law does not define the term \"rental company\" for purposes of these motor carrier insurance provisions.\n\nThis bill creates a definition of \"rental company\" for purposes of these motor carrier insurance provisions.  The bill defines a \"rental company\" as a person that rents motor vehicles to common motor carriers of property, contract motor carriers, or private motor carriers transporting hazardous materials.  The bill also specifies that these motor carrier insurance provisions are applicable only to a rental company's vehicles that are rented to a common motor carrier of property, contract motor carrier, or private motor carrier transporting hazardous materials.\n\nFor further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB942,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  194.01 (12m) of the statutes is created to read:\nAB942,2,42\n194.01 (12m)  \"Rental company\" means a person that rents motor vehicles to 3common motor carriers of property, contract motor carriers, or private motor carriers 4transporting hazardous materials as listed under 49 CFR 172.101.AB942,2\n\n\n5Section \n2.  194.41 (1) of the statutes is amended to read:\nAB942,3,236\n194.41 (1)  No permit or vehicle registration may be issued to a common motor 7carrier of property, contract motor carrier, or rental company, no permit or vehicle 8registration may remain in force to operate any motor vehicle under the authority 9of this chapter, and no vehicle registration may be issued or remain in force for a 10semitrailer unless the carrier or rental company has on file with the department and 11in effect an approved certificate for a policy of insurance or other written contract in 12such form and containing such terms and conditions as may be approved by the 13department issued by an insurer authorized to do a surety or automobile liability 14business in this state under which the insurer assumes the liability prescribed by 15this section with respect to the operation of such motor vehicles.  The certificate or 16other contract is subject to the approval of the department and shall provide that the 1insurer shall be directly liable for and shall pay all damages for injuries to or for the 2death of persons or for injuries to or destruction of property that may be recovered 3against the owner or operator of any such motor vehicles by reason of the negligent 4operation thereof in such amount as the department may require.  Liability may be 5restricted so as to be inapplicable to damage claims on account of injury to or 6destruction of property transported, but the department may require, and with 7respect to a carrier transporting a building, as defined in s. 348.27 (12m) (a) 1., shall 8require, a certificate or other contract protecting the owner of the property 9transported by carriers from loss or damage in the amount and under the conditions 10as the department may require.

Referred to Committee on Education.\n\nAB951,1,5\n1An Act to amend 20.255 (2) (fm), 20.255 (2) (fp) and 118.40 (2r) (g) 1. e.; and to 2create 118.40 (2r) (fm), 118.40 (2r) (g) 1. bf., 118.40 (2r) (g) 1. bn., 118.40 (2r) 3(g) 1. df., 118.40 (2r) (g) 1. dn., 118.40 (2x) (em) and 118.40 (2x) (f) 1. c., d. and 4e. of the statutes; relating to: summer school payments to operators of 5independent charter schools and making an appropriation.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nThis bill requires the Department of Public Instruction to pay an operator of an independent charter school for pupils who attend summer school at the independent charter school in the same manner that DPI pays a private school participating in a parental choice program for pupils who attend summer school at the participating private school.  Under current law, DPI does not pay an operator of an independent charter school for pupils who attend summer school at the independent charter school.\n\nUnder the bill, the amount paid for each pupil who attends summer school at the independent charter school is 5 percent of the per pupil amount paid to the operator for a pupil who attends the independent charter school for the school year.

Referred to Committee on Transportation.\n\nAB956,1,5\n1An Act to repeal 134.405 (3m), 134.405 (5) (a) (intro.) and 134.405 (5) (am); to 2renumber 134.405 (5) (a) 1., 134.405 (5) (a) 2. and 134.405 (5) (a) 3.; to amend 3134.405 (2), 134.405 (3) (a) (intro.), 218.20 (1r) and 218.23 (1r); and to create 4218.20 (1v) of the statutes; relating to: acquisition of a motor vehicle by scrap 5metal dealers and motor vehicle salvage dealers.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nThis bill requires scrap metal processors and dealers who acquire a motor vehicle for scrap or salvage to comply with the same requirements as motor vehicle salvage dealers, and changes certain requirements that apply before a motor vehicle salvage dealer may acquire a motor vehicle in which another person holds a security interest.\n\nThis bill changes the definition of a \"motor vehicle salvage dealer\" to include a scrap metal processor or scrap metal dealer who acquires a motor vehicle for scrap or salvage.  Under current law, a motor vehicle salvage dealer must be licensed by the Department of Transportation and comply with certain requirements.  Under current law, a \"scrap metal processor\" is a person who processes or scraps motor vehicles but does not sell motor vehicles or vehicle parts and whose business is limited to a fixed location where scrap metal is processed into prepared grades for sale for remelting.  A \"scrap metal dealer\" is a person engaged in the business of buying or selling scrap metal.  The bill also eliminates certain requirements under current law that apply to scrap metal dealers who acquire a motor vehicle, relating to the acquisition of a motor vehicle whose certificate of title identifies a holder of a security interest, that are the same as requirements that apply to motor vehicle salvage dealers under current law.\n\nIn addition, the bill allows a licensed motor vehicle salvage dealer to acquire a motor vehicle whose certificate of title identifies a holder of a security interest, for the purpose of wrecking or junking the vehicle, if the dealer pays the amount of the outstanding obligation represented by the security interest in full to the security interest holder when the dealer obtains the title for the vehicle.  Current law prohibits a motor vehicle salvage dealer from acquiring such a motor vehicle.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB956,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  134.405 (2) of the statutes, as affected by 2015 Wisconsin Act 55, 2is amended to read:\nAB956,2,53\n134.405 (2)  Purchases of ferrous scrap.

Current law allows DHS to request admission to a dwelling or premises to conduct a lead investigation when the department is notified that an occupant of a dwelling or premises who is under six years of age has a level of lead in the blood of ten or more micrograms per 1000 milliliters of blood, and requires DHS to conduct a lead investigation if the level of lead is either 20 or more micrograms per 100 milliliters of blood, as confirmed by one venous blood test, or 15 or more micrograms per 100 milliliters of blood, as confirmed by two venous blood tests that are performed at least 90 days apart.\n\nThis bill also provides funding to pay for the cost of the testing required by the bill.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB957,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  254.151 (2) of the statutes is amended to read:\nAB957,2,42\n254.151 (2)  To fund lead poisoning or lead exposure screening, care 3coordination and follow-up services, including lead investigations, to children under 4age 6 who are not covered by a 3rd-party payer.\nAB957,2\n\n\n5Section \n2.  254.151 (2m) of the statutes is created to read:\nAB957,2,66\n254.151 (2m)  To fund lead investigations under s. 254.166 (1).\nAB957,3\n\n\n7Section \n3.  254.166 (1) of the statutes is amended to read:\nAB957,3,118\n254.166 (1)  The department may, after \nNotwithstanding ss. 254.11 (intro.) and 9(9) and 254.156, for purposes of this subsection, \"lead poisoning or lead exposure\" 10means a level of lead in the blood of 5 or more micrograms per 100 milliliters of blood.  11After being notified that an occupant of a dwelling or premises who is under 6 years 12of age has blood lead poisoning or lead exposure, present official credentials to the 13owner or occupant of the dwelling or premises, or to a representative of the owner, 14and request admission to conduct a lead investigation of the dwelling or premises.  15If the department is notified that an occupant of a dwelling or premises who is a child 16under 6 years of age has an elevated blood lead level, the department shall conduct 17a lead investigation of the dwelling or premises or ensure that a lead investigation 18of the dwelling or premises is conducted, including water testing and testing for any 19lead-based paint hazard.

Taylor. Referred to Committee on Health.\n\nAB959,1,7\n1An Act to repeal 948.03 (6); and to amend 48.981 (3) (c) 3., 48.981 (3) (c) 4., 2448.03 (6) and 938.505 (2) (a) 1. of the statutes; relating to: elimination of a 3provision that excepts spiritual treatment of a child in the law criminalizing 4physical abuse of a child and in the laws governing the practice of medicine or 5surgery, the investigation of child abuse or neglect, the administration of 6psychotropic medication to juveniles in correctional custody, and the election of 7Christian Science treatment in lieu of medical or surgical treatment.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nUnder current law, physical abuse of a child, including intentional causation of bodily harm, reckless causation of bodily harm, and failure by persons responsible for a child's welfare to act to prevent bodily harm is a felony.  However, current law provides that a person is not guilty of physical abuse of a child solely because he or she provides certain forms of spiritual treatment versus medical or surgical treatment.  This bill eliminates this provision.\n\nUnder current law, a county department of human services or social services (county department) that receives a report of suspected or threatened abuse or neglect by a caregiver of a child must investigate to determine whether abuse or neglect has occurred or is likely to occur and whether the child, a member of the child's family, or the child's guardian or legal custodian is in need of services.  Current law, however, provides that a determination that abuse or neglect has occurred may not be based solely on the fact that the child's parent, guardian, or legal custodian in good faith selects and relies on prayer or other religious means for treatment of disease or for remedial care of the child.  This bill eliminates that provision and instead provides that a county department may not base a determination that a child, a member of a child's family, or a child's guardian or legal custodian is in need of services solely on the fact that the child's parent, guardian, or legal custodian has cultural or religious child-rearing beliefs and employs cultural or religious child-rearing practices that differ from general community standards, unless those beliefs and practices present a specific danger to the physical or emotional health or safety of the child.\n\nUnder current law, the court assigned to exercise jurisdiction under the Juvenile Justice Code (juvenile court) may grant permission for the Department of Corrections (DOC) or a county department to administer psychotropic medication to a juvenile 14 years of age or over who is under the supervision of DOC or the county department and who wishes to be administered such medication if the consent of the juvenile's parent or guardian is unreasonably withheld, a physician has determined that the juvenile is in need of such medication, and the juvenile is competent to consent to the administration of such medication.  Current law, however, provides that the juvenile court may not determine that a parent's or guardian's consent is unreasonably withheld solely because the parent or guardian relies on treatment by spiritual means through prayer for healing in accordance with his or her religious tradition.  This bill eliminates that provision.\n\nCurrent law provides that a person who elects Christian Science treatment in lieu of medical or surgical treatment for the cure of disease may not be compelled to submit to medical or surgical treatment.  The bill limits the provision to apply only to the election of Christian Science treatment by an adult patient.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB959,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  48.981 (3) (c) 3. of the statutes is amended to read:\nAB959,3,142\n48.981 (3) (c) 3.

A determination that a child, a member 3of a child's family, a child's guardian or legal custodian, or an expectant mother of an 4unborn child is in need of services may not be based solely on the fact that the child's 5parent, guardian, or legal custodian or the expectant mother has cultural or religious 6child-rearing beliefs and employs cultural or religious child-rearing practices that 7differ from general community standards, unless those beliefs and practices present 8a specific danger to the physical or emotional health or safety of the child.  If the 9child's parent, guardian, or legal custodian or the expectant mother refuses to accept 10the services, the county department, department, or licensed child welfare agency 11may request that a petition be filed under s. 48.13 alleging that the child who is the 12subject of the report or any other child in the home is in need of protection or services 13or that a petition be filed under s. 48.133 alleging that the unborn child who is the 14subject of the report is in need of protection or services.\nAB959,2\n\n\n15Section \n2.  48.981 (3) (c) 4. of the statutes is amended to read:\nAB959,4,516\n48.981 (3) (c) 4.

The 21determination shall be based on a preponderance of the evidence produced by the 22investigation.   A determination that abuse or neglect has occurred may not be based 23solely on the fact that the child's parent, guardian, or legal custodian in good faith 24selects and relies on prayer or other religious means for treatment of disease or for 25remedial care of the child.  In making a determination that emotional damage has 1occurred, the county department or, in a county having a population of 500,000 or 2more, the department or a licensed child welfare agency under contract with the 3department shall give due regard to the culture of the subjects.  \nThis subdivision does 4not prohibit a court from ordering medical services for the child if the child's health 5requires it.\nAB959,3\n\n\n6Section \n3.  448.03 (6) of the statutes is amended to read:\nAB959,4,117\n448.03 (6)  Practice of Christian Science.

Current law specifically classifies police officers, fire fighters, and various other individuals as protective occupation participants.  Under the WRS, the normal retirement age of a protective occupation participant is lower than that of other participants and the percentage multiplier used to calculate retirement annuities is higher for protective occupation participants than for other participants.\n\nThis bill permits counties to classify county jailers, detention officers, and correctional officers eligible as protective occupation participants under the WRS without a requirement that their principal duties involve active law enforcement or active fire suppression or prevention.\n\nBecause this bill relates to public employee retirement or pensions, it may be referred to the Joint Survey Committee on Retirement Systems for a report to be printed as an appendix to the bill.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB973,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  40.02 (17) (n) of the statutes is created to read:\nAB973,2,102\n40.02 (17) (n)  Notwithstanding par.

Monetary bail may be satisfied by the execution of a bail bond with sufficient sureties or by payment of the indicated amount in cash.  Current law allows a court to impose other conditions of release, including limitations on travel and requirements for the defendant to avoid alcohol or controlled substances, to avoid contact with certain persons, and to participate in certain programs.  If the defendant fails to appear in subsequent proceedings or violates a condition of release, he or she forfeits the monetary bail.\n\nUnder the bill, a court is required to release a defendant before trial unless it finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that there is a substantial risk that the defendant will not appear for trial or will cause serious bodily harm to a member of the community or intimidate a witness if he or she is released.  Under the bill, the court may not use the nature, number, and gravity of the offenses as the sole sufficient reason for refusing to release the defendant.\n\nThe bill also eliminates the practice of imposing a monetary bail on a witness to ensure the witness's appearance at trial, eliminates the use of monetary bail to compensate victims of crimes, and eliminates the use of monetary bail as a means of securing a person's appearance in a civil forfeiture action.\n\nThe bill allows the court to set nonmonetary conditions of release for defendants and for persons convicted of a crime but not sentenced or ordered to release upon or pending appeal.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB981,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  16.846 (3) of the statutes is amended to read:\nAB981,3,62\n16.846 (3)  All fines imposed and collected under this section shall be 3transmitted to the county treasurer for disposition in accordance with s. 59.25 (3) (f) 4and (j).

Current law allows the officer, if he or she reasonably believes that he or she or another person is in physical danger, to search the person for weapons during the questioning and, if any weapon is found, to take the weapon until the person is either arrested or released after questioning.\n\nUnder the bill, the person's presence in a high-crime area may not constitute reasonable suspicion for a stop, a search, or a taking of a weapon.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB984,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  968.24 of the statutes is amended to read:\nAB984,2,11\n2968.24  Temporary questioning without arrest.  After having identified 3himself or herself as a law enforcement officer, a law enforcement officer may stop 4a person in a public place for a reasonable period of time when the officer reasonably 5suspects that such person is committing, is about to commit or has committed a 6crime, and may demand the name and address of the person and an explanation of 7the person's conduct.  The person's presence in a geographic area that has a higher 8rate of crime relative to other geographic areas in the state or within the local unit 9of government, as defined in s. 323.02 (15), may not constitute reasonable suspicion 10to stop or to question a person under this section.  Such detention and temporary 11questioning shall be conducted in the vicinity where the person was stopped.\nAB984,2\n\n\n12Section \n2.  968.25 of the statutes is amended to read:\nAB984,3,2\n13968.25  Search during temporary questioning.  When a law enforcement 14officer has stopped a person for temporary questioning pursuant to s. 968.24 and 15reasonably suspects that he or she or another is in danger of physical injury, the law 16enforcement officer may search such person for weapons or any instrument or article 17or substance readily capable of causing physical injury and of a sort not ordinarily 18carried in public places by law abiding persons.  If the law enforcement officer finds 19such a weapon or instrument, or any other property possession of which the law 20enforcement officer reasonably believes may constitute the commission of a crime, 21or which may constitute a threat to his or her safety, the law enforcement officer may 22take it and keep it until the completion of the questioning, at which time the law 23enforcement officer shall either return it, if lawfully possessed, or arrest the person 24so questioned.  The person's presence in a geographic area that has a higher rate of 25crime relative to other geographic areas in the state or within the local unit of 1government, as defined in s. 323.02 (15), may not constitute reasonable suspicion for 2a search or a taking under this section.\nAB984,3,33\n(End)\n            Down\r\n        Down\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n"

The bill provides that an egg retrieval is required to be covered only if all high quality embryos resulting from any previous covered egg retrieval have been used in embryo transfers performed on the insured.  In addition, if the eggs retrieved under a covered retrieval are of poor quality, a health care plan must cover all double embryo transfers to an insured under age 35 and all triple embryo transfers to an insured between ages 35 and 42.\n\nThe coverage requirement applies to all health care plans that provide maternity coverage, including individual health insurance policies and group health plans, health maintenance organizations, preferred provider plans, plans of cooperative sickness care associations, plans offered by the state to its employees, and self-insured plans of counties, cities, towns, villages, and school districts.  Excluded from the requirement is health care provided to Medical Assistance recipients.\n\nThe bill provides that copayments and deductibles for the infertility coverage may not be greater than any copayments or deductibles for the maternity coverage under the health care plan.  The bill also provides that the coverage required for procedures in connection with in vitro fertilization is the lifetime maximum coverage for any insured under all health care plans covering that insured during her lifetime.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB989,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  49.45 (20m) of the statutes is created to read:\nAB989,2,62\n49.45 (20m)  Exemption from infertility coverage requirements.  3Notwithstanding s. 632.755 (1g) (c), an insurer with which the department contracts 4under sub.

The remainder of the 4sentence is the entire sentence, less time served in custody prior to parole and time 5served on parole prior to revocation.

The bill reclassifies the crime of issuing a worthless check to a Class A misdemeanor, regardless of the amount for which the check was written.  Under current law, issuing a worthless check is a Class I felony if the check was written for more than $2,500.  The bill also reclassifies the crime of fraudulent writing from a Class H felony to a Class A misdemeanor.\n\nIn addition, the bill changes how the crime of bail jumping is classified.  Under current law, a person is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor if he or she intentionally violates the conditions of his or release pending trial if the trial relates to a misdemeanor charge, but is guilty of a Class H felony if the trial relates to a felony charge.  Under the bill, a person who intentionally violates the conditions of his or her release is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor unless he or she is charged with committing a new crime while he or she is released pending trial, in which case he or she is guilty of a Class H felony.\n\nThe bill also reclassifies second offense possession of marijuana from a Class I felony to a Class A misdemeanor.  Under current law, first offense possession of marijuana is a Class A misdemeanor, while a second or subsequent offense for possessing marijuana is a Class I felony.  Under the bill, a first or second offense is a Class A misdemeanor, and a third or subsequent offense is a Class I felony.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB994,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  103.34 (1) (b) 3. of the statutes is amended to read:\nAB994,2,52\n103.34 (1) (b) 3.

Under the bill, the person is guilty of a Class B misdemeanor if his or her conduct does cause or provoke a disturbance, and subject to a Class A forfeiture if his or her conduct does not cause or provoke a disturbance.\n\nUnder current law, a person is generally guilty of a Class A misdemeanor if he or she steals merchandise that is worth less than $500.  Under the bill, the person is subject to a Class A forfeiture if he or she steals merchandise that is less than $500 and the merchandise is recovered by the merchant, but guilty of the Class A misdemeanor if the merchandise is not recovered by the merchant.\n\nThe bill changes the penalties for marijuana possession.  Under current law, a person who possesses marijuana may, for a first offense, be fined up to $1,000, imprisoned for up to six months, or both.  A second or subsequent offense is a Class I felony.  Under the bill, a person who possesses marijuana may, for a first offense, be fined up to $1,000, imprisoned for up three months, or both; a person who commits a second offense may be fined up to $1,000, imprisoned for up to six months, or both; and a person who commits a third or subsequent offense is guilty of a Class I felony.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB995,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  48.685 (2) (bb) of the statutes is amended to read:\nAB995,2,202\n48.685 (2) (bb)  If information obtained under par.

If a person's confinement portion is extended for such a violation, current law requires his or her extended supervision portion to be reduced so that the total length of the person's sentence remains unchanged.\n\nCurrent law allows a person who is sentenced to a bifurcated sentence for a Class C to Class I felony to petition the sentencing court to adjust his or her sentence and release the person from prison to extended supervision if he or she has served 85 percent for a Class C to Class E felony, or 75 percent for a Class F to Class I felony, of the confinement portion of the sentence.  If a person's confinement portion is reduced by the sentencing court, current law requires his or her extended supervision portion to be extended so that the total length of the person's sentence remains unchanged.\n\nUnder this bill, a person who commits a misdemeanor and is sentenced to imprisonment or who commits a Class C to Class I felony may accumulate \"earned time\" in the amount of one day for every five days he or she is incarcerated without violating a prison rule or regulation.  The bill requires the Department of Corrections to release the person to extended supervision when he or she serves his or her entire incarceration period, minus earned time accumulated.\n\nUnder the bill, if a person's incarceration period is reduced by earned time, his or her period of extended supervision is increased so that the length of the sentence does not change.  The bill eliminates the right of a person to petition the sentencing court to adjust his or her sentence.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB999,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  302.113 (2) of the statutes is renumbered 302.113 (2) (a) and 2amended to read:\nAB999,2,73\n302.113 (2) (a)  Except as provided in par.

Referred to Committee on State Affairs and Government Operations.\n\nAB1003,1,4\n1An Act to repeal 779.14 (1s); and to amend 779.14 (1e) (b), 779.14 (1m) (c) 1. 2(intro.), 779.14 (1m) (c) 2.

(intro.) and 779.14 (1m) (d) 3. of the statutes; relating to: 4indexing dollar amounts for certain public works contracts.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nThis bill eliminates the requirement for the Department of Workforce Development (DWD) to index dollar amounts for certain public projects.  Current law sets forth provisions that are required to be included in certain contracts with the state or with local units of government for public improvements or other public works.  The required provisions vary depending on the amount of money involved in the contract.  Current law lists certain requirements for every contract involving $10,000 or more for performing, furnishing, or procuring labor, services, materials, plans, or specifications, and other requirements for every contract involving $30,000 or more for those items.\n\nCurrent law requires varying provisions in state contracts for public improvements or other public works involving more than $10,000 but less than $100,000, in contracts involving more than $100,000 but less than $250,000, and in contracts involving more than $250,000.  Current law also requires varying provisions in local government contracts for public improvements and other public works involving more than $10,000 but less than $50,000, in contracts involving more than $50,000 but less than $100,000, and in contracts involving more than $100,000.\n\nCurrent law requires DWD to index the dollar amounts biennially and to keep adjustments proportional to the last adjustment.  Under current law, DWD need not make an adjustment for a biennium if the adjustment would be less than five percent.\n\nThis bill sets the dollar amounts involved in the contracts for public improvements or other public works at their current indexed levels and eliminates future indexing.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB1003,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  779.14 (1e) (b) of the statutes is amended to read:\nAB1003,2,82\n779.14 (1e) (b)  All contracts that are in excess of $30,000, as indexed under sub. 3(1s), and that are for performing, furnishing, or procuring labor, services, materials, 4plans, or specifications for a public improvement or public work shall contain a 5provision under which the prime contractor agrees, to the extent practicable, to 6maintain a list of all subcontractors, suppliers, and service providers performing, 7furnishing, or procuring labor, services, materials, plans, or specifications under the 8contract.\nAB1003,2\n\n\n9Section \n2.  779.14 (1m) (c) 1.

Referred to Committee on Judiciary.\n\nAB1005,1,5\n1An Act to repeal 973.015 (title) and (1m); to renumber 973.015 (2m); to 2renumber and amend 973.015 (3); to amend 301.45 (1p) (a), 301.45 (7) (e) 2., 3301.45 (7) (e) 3., 452.01 (3p) and 452.01 (4v); and to create 778.095, 939.76, 4939.77 (title) and 939.77 (2) (a) of the statutes; relating to: petitions for 5expungement of certain court records.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nThis bill establishes criteria for expunging certain civil and criminal court records. Under current law, if a person is convicted of a criminal offense for which the maximum period of imprisonment is not more than six years and the person committed the offense before he or she was 25 years old, the court may order, at the time the person is sentenced, that the person's record of the offense be expunged when the person completes his or her sentence or any period of probation imposed for the offense.  Current law excludes certain offenses from expungement and generally requires the court to determine that the person will benefit from, and society will not be harmed by, expungement.\n\nUnder this bill, a person who has been convicted of a criminal offense for which the maximum period of imprisonment is not more than six years, or who has been ordered to pay a forfeiture related to a criminal charge, except an offense related to a violation of a traffic law, may petition the court for an order expunging the record of his or her offense or forfeiture.  The bill retains the requirement that, in order to be eligible for an order of expungement, the person who is convicted of a crime or found to have committed a civil offense be under the age of 25 when he or she committed the offense.\n\nUnder the bill, the record of a civil violation may be expunged when the person has satisfied the judgment against him or her, including paying all costs, fees, surcharges, and restitution ordered or assessed, and the record of a criminal conviction may be expunged when the person completes his or her sentence.\n\nA person who was sentenced to imprisonment or placed on probation has completed his or her sentence if he or she has not been convicted of a subsequent criminal offense; he or she has completed his or her term of imprisonment or probation; the detaining or probationary authority has issued a certificate of discharge; and the person has paid all costs, fees, surcharges, and restitution ordered or assessed.  A person who is not sentenced to a term of imprisonment or placed on probation has completed his or her sentence if the person provides sufficient proof to the court that all conditions of his or her sentence have been fulfilled.\n\nUnder the bill, if a person was charged with a crime or a violation not related to a traffic law but the person was acquitted of the charge, the charge was dismissed, or the conviction or imposition of a forfeiture was reversed, set aside, or vacated, the person may petition the court at any time to expunge the circuit court record related to the offense.  Under the bill, there is no age limit regarding when the alleged offense was committed for a person who petitions for expungement on these grounds.\n\nUnder the bill, a court may order that the record of the case be expunged if the court determines that all charges, orders, or judgments against the person are eligible for expungement, that the person will benefit from, and that society will not be harmed by, the expungement.  The bill requires the clerk of courts to take certain actions upon receiving an order of expungement, including informing the Department of Justice that an order of expungement has been entered, removing electronic records of the case, and sealing the file.\n\nThe bill excludes certain violations from expungement, including traffic violations and certain felonies, if the felony is violent, the person has a history of violent offenses, or the felony is for stalking or certain crimes against children.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB1005,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  301.45 (1p) (a) of the statutes, as affected by 2015 Wisconsin Act 80, 2is amended to read:\nAB1005,3,23\n301.45 (1p) (a)  If a person is covered under sub.

Larson, Lassa, Wirch, Risser and Carpenter. Referred to Committee on Energy and Utilities.\n\nAB1007,1,6\n1An Act to repeal 66.0420 (5) (a) 2. b. and 2. c.; to renumber and amend 66.0420 2(5) (a) 2. a.; to amend 66.0420 (5) (a) 3., 66.0420 (5) (b) 1. a., 66.0420 (5) (c) 1., 366.0420 (5) (d) 1. and 66.0420 (7) (f); to repeal and recreate 66.0420 (5) (c) 3. 4a.; and to create 66.0420 (5) (d) 3. and 4. and 66.0420 (7) (es) of the statutes; 5relating to: public, educational, and governmental access channel 6requirements for video service providers and interim cable operators.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nThis bill makes changes to requirements regarding public, educational, and governmental access channels (PEG channels).  Under current law, the duty of a video service provider or interim cable operator to provide monetary support to a municipality for access facilities for PEG channels expired on January 1, 2011.  A video service provider is a person to whom the Department of Financial Institutions has granted a franchise that allows the person to provide cable television or comparable service through facilities located, at least in part, in public rights-of-way.  An interim cable operator is a person to whom a municipality granted a cable television franchise under prior law.  Upon expiration of a municipally granted franchise, current law requires the holder of the franchise to obtain a video service franchise granted by DFI.\n\nThe bill allows a municipality to require, beginning on January 1, 2017, video service providers and interim cable operators to pay a fee for the purpose of supporting PEG channels.  The fee, which must be set by ordinance, may be equal to no more than 1 percent of a video service provider's or interim cable operator's annual gross receipts.  The bill also makes video service providers and interim cable operators responsible for making any changes to PEG channel content or programming that are necessary for compatibility with their service-delivery technology or protocol.  Under current law, municipalities that provide PEG channel programming are responsible for such changes.\n\nThe bill also requires video service providers and interim cable operators to provide channel capacity for PEG channels with accessibility, functionality, and audio and visual quality that is at least equivalent to certain commercial channels.  In addition, the bill requires video service providers and interim cable operators to do the following:  1) provide channel capacity for PEG channels so that it is viewable by subscribers without additional service or equipment charges; 2) provide such channel capacity on a service tier that is viewable by 100 percent of customers, rather than by more than 50 percent, which is required under current law; 3) upon request, put the PEG channel schedule into the electronic program guide with the same functionality as commercial broadcast channels; and 4) provide facilities adequate to carry signals for PEG channels without material degradation, alteration, or removal of PEG channel content.  Also, the bill clarifies duties under current law regarding the relocation of origination points for PEG channels.  Additionally, the bill eliminates the authority of a video service provider or interim cable operator to provide certain restored PEG channel capacity on any service tier.  Finally, the bill eliminates limits on the aggregate number of PEG channels that apply to video service providers and interim cable operators that provide video programming to more than one municipality.\n\nFor further information see the local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB1007,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  66.0420 (5) (a) 2. a. of the statutes is renumbered 66.0420 (5) (a) 2. 2and amended to read:\nAB1007,3,43\n66.0420 (5) (a) 2.

(a) if the PEG channel is 15not substantially utilized by the municipality.  If the municipality certifies to the 16interim cable operator or video service provider that reprogrammed channel capacity 17for a PEG channel will be substantially utilized by the municipality, the interim cable 18operator or video service provider shall, no later than 120 days after receipt of the 19certification, restore the channel capacity for the PEG channel.  \nNotwithstanding 20par. (a) 3., an interim cable operator or video service provider may provide restored 21channel capacity for a PEG channel on any service tier.\nAB1007,5\n\n\n22Section \n5.  66.0420 (5) (c) 1. of the statutes is amended to read:\nAB1007,4,223\n66.0420 (5) (c) 1.

(d) 3., submit the content or programming to the interim cable operator or 9video service provider in that manner or form.  If the municipality does not produce 10or maintain PEG channel content or programming in such manner or form, the 11interim cable operator or video service provider shall be responsible at its sole cost 12for any changes in the manner or form of the transmission that are necessary to make 13PEG channel content or programming compatible with the technology or protocol 14used by the interim cable operator or video service provider to deliver services.\nAB1007,7\n\n\n15Section \n7.  66.0420 (5) (d) 1. of the statutes is amended to read:\nAB1007,5,1216\n66.0420 (5) (d) 1.

A municipality shall permit the interim cable operator or video service 23provider to determine the most economically and technologically efficient means of 24providing such equipment and transmission capacity.  If a municipality requests that 25such a PEG access channel origination point be relocated, the interim cable operator 1or video service provider shall be required to provide only the first 200 feet of 2transmission line beginning at the relocated origination point that is necessary to 3connect the relocated origination point to the interim cable operator or video service 4provider's headend or, video hub office \nto such origination point, or equivalent 5transmission facilities.  A municipality shall be liable for the costs of construction of 6such a transmission line beyond the first 200 feet from the relocated origination point 7to the headend, video hub office, or equivalent transmission facilities and for any 8construction costs associated with additional origination points, but not for the costs 9associated with the transmission of PEG programming over such line.  The interim 10cable operator or video service provider may recover its costs to provide equipment 11and transmission capacity under this subdivision by identifying and collecting a 12\"PEG Transport Fee\" as a separate line item on customer bills.\nAB1007,8\n\n\n13Section \n8.  66.0420 (5) (d) 3. and 4. of the statutes are created to read:\nAB1007,5,1914\n66.0420 (5) (d) 3.

Referred to Committee on Family Law.\n\nAB1012,1,6\n1An Act to renumber and amend 48.23 (4); \nto amend 48.20 (8) (a), 48.21 (3) (d), 248.213 (2) (d), 48.23 (3) and 977.075 (4); and to create 48.23 (2) (d), 48.23 (4) 3(c) and 48.23 (6) of the statutes; relating to: the right of a parent to have 4counsel in a proceeding for a child alleged to be in need of protection or services; 5the power of the juvenile court to appoint counsel in such a proceeding; granting 6rule-making authority; and making appropriations.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nThis bill permits the court assigned to exercise jurisdiction under the Children's Code (juvenile court) to appoint counsel for any party to a child in need of protection or services (CHIPS) proceeding.  Current law prohibits the juvenile court from appointing counsel for any party to a CHIPS proceeding, other than the child, but that prohibition was ruled unconstitutional by the Wisconsin Supreme Court in Joni B. v. State, 202 Wis. 2d 1 (1996).\n\nThe bill also requires a parent of a child who is the subject of a CHIPS proceeding to be represented by counsel in the proceeding, if the child has been taken into custody or ordered to be placed outside of his or her home.  In that situation, the parent must be referred to the State Public Defender, who must appoint counsel for the parent without a determination of indigency.  The juvenile court may, however, order the parent to reimburse the state for all or part of the costs of that representation at the conclusion of the proceeding.  These provisions sunset on June 30, 2019.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB1012,1\n\n1Section \n1.  48.20 (8) (a) of the statutes is amended to read:\nAB1012,2,172\n48.20 (8) (a)  If a child is held in custody, the intake worker shall notify the 3child's parent, guardian, legal custodian, and Indian custodian of the reasons for 4holding the child in custody and of the child's whereabouts unless there is reason to 5believe that notice would present imminent danger to the child.  The parent, 6guardian, legal custodian, and Indian custodian shall also be notified of the time and 7place of the detention hearing required under s. 48.21, the nature and possible 8consequences of that hearing, the right to counsel under s. 48.23 regardless of ability 9to pay, the right to present and cross-examine witnesses at the hearing, and, in the 10case of a parent or Indian custodian of an Indian child who is the subject of an Indian 11child custody proceeding, as defined in s. 48.028 (2) (d) 2., the right to counsel under 12s. 48.028 (4) (b).  If the parent, guardian, legal custodian, or Indian custodian is not 13immediately available, the intake worker or another person designated by the court 14shall provide notice as soon as possible.  When the child is 12 years of age or older, 15the child shall receive the same notice about the detention hearing as the parent, 16guardian, legal custodian, or Indian custodian.

Once begun, the right 22to be represented by counsel continues throughout all stages of the proceedings.

Referred to Committee on Environment and Forestry.\n\nAB1014,1,4\n1An Act to amend 281.36 (3b) (b), 281.36 (3m) (a), 281.36 (6) (a) (intro.) and 2281.36 (9) (a) (intro.); and to create 281.36 (4m) of the statutes; relating to: 3the discharge of dredged or fill material into artificial wetlands and requiring 4the exercise of rule-making authority.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nThis bill exempts from wetland permitting requirements a discharge of dredged or fill material into an artificial wetland.\n\nCurrent law requires the Department of Natural Resources to issue wetland general permits for discharges of dredged or fill material into certain wetlands.  Current law allows DNR to establish different requirements, conditions, and exceptions in general permits to ensure that the discharges will cause only minimal adverse environmental effects.  A person who wishes to proceed with a discharge that is covered by a general permit must notify DNR.  If DNR does not request additional information or notify the person that an individual permit will be required within 30 days after receipt of the notification, the person may proceed with the discharge.\n\nCurrent law also authorizes DNR to require a person to apply for and obtain a wetland individual permit if DNR determines that conditions specific to the site require additional restrictions on the discharge in order to provide reasonable assurance that no significant adverse impacts to wetland functional values will occur.  Also under current law, before DNR may issue a wetland individual permit, it must require the restoration, enhancement, creation, or preservation of other wetlands to compensate for adverse impacts to a wetland resulting from the discharge, also known as mitigation.\n\nUnder current rules promulgated by DNR, certain artificial wetlands are exempt from the wetland permitting requirements unless DNR determines that significant functional values are present.  This bill exempts from these permitting requirements a discharge to any artificial wetland.  The bill defines an artificial wetland as a wetland inadvertently created by human modifications to the landscape or hydrology and for which there is no prior wetland or stream history, but excludes from the definition a wetland that is subject to federal jurisdiction and a wetland that serves as a fish spawning area or a passage to a fish spawning area.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB1014,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  281.36 (3b) (b) of the statutes is amended to read:\nAB1014,2,92\n281.36 (3b) (b)  No person may discharge dredged material or fill material into 3a wetland unless the discharge is authorized by a wetland general permit or 4individual permit issued by the department under this section or the discharge is 5exempt under sub.

In addition, current law allows the Public Service Commission (PSC) to promulgate rules designating other resources as renewable resources.  Under that authority, the PSC has promulgated rules designating biogas a renewable resource.  Current law also provides for the creation of credits based on the electricity that an electric provider derives from renewable resources.  An electric provider may use the credits it creates to comply with an RPS for a particular year or sell the credits to another electric provider who may use the purchased credits to comply with an RPS.  The bill eliminates all of the foregoing requirements and provisions.\n\nThe bill also eliminates a goal under current law that, by December 31, 2015, 10 percent of all electricity consumed in the state is derived from renewable resources.  In addition, the bill eliminates a requirement under current law for the PSC to make annual reports regarding the goal.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB1015,1\n\n\n3Section \n1.  16.75 (12) (a) 4. of the statutes is amended to read:\nAB1015,2,64\n16.75 (12) (a) 4.  \"Renewable resource\" has the meaning given in s. 196.378 (1) 5(h) 1. or 2. 79.005 (3r) (a) and includes a resource, as defined in s. 196.378 (1) (j) 79.005 6(5), that derives electricity from hydroelectric power.\nAB1015,2\n\n\n7Section \n2.  26.42 (1) (c) of the statutes is amended to read:\nAB1015,2,98\n26.42 (1) (c)  Electricity, including electricity that satisfies the requirements in 9s. 196.378 (2).\nAB1015,3\n\n\n1Section \n3.  66.0401 (1e) (a) of the statutes is amended to read:\nAB1015,3,42\n66.0401 (1e) (a)  \"Application for approval\" means an application for approval 3of a wind energy system under rules promulgated by the commission under s. 4196.378 (4g) (c) 1 196.379 (3) (a).\nAB1015,4\n\n\n5Section \n4.  66.0401 (1m) (intro.) of the statutes is amended to read:\nAB1015,3,126\n66.0401 (1m)  Authority to restrict systems limited.

Referred to Committee on Rules.\n\nAB1021,1,7\n1An Act to renumber 118.60 (1) (ag) 1. to 3. and 119.23 (1) (ag) 1. to 3.; to amend 2118.60 (1) (ag) (intro.), 118.60 (10) (a) 8., 119.23 (1) (ag) (intro.) and 119.23 (10) 3(a) 8.; and to create 118.60 (1) (ag) 2m., 118.60 (1) (ag) 3m., 118.60 (1) (ag) 4m., 4118.60 (10) (a) 9., 119.23 (1) (ag) 2m., 119.23 (1) (ag) 3m., 119.23 (1) (ag) 4m. and 5119.23 (10) (a) 9. of the statutes; \nrelating to: persons disqualified from having 6certain responsibilities in a private school participating in a parental choice 7program.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nThis bill broadens the authority of the Department of Public Instruction to bar from participation in a parental choice program a private school that hires or retains a disqualified person.  The bill also modifies the definition of disqualified person to include the following persons:  1) a person for whom a license to operate a child care center was denied, revoked, suspended, not renewed, or not continued; 2) a person who has been convicted of, or pled guilty or no contest to, a crime involving an act of fraud or dishonesty against an agency or political subdivision of this state or against a federal agency; and 3) a person who would not be eligible under current law to be employed or licensed as a teacher for reasons including conviction of a felony for a crime against life or bodily security or public health and safety.\n\nCurrent law permits DPI to issue an order that bars a private school from participating in a parental choice program or that terminates the participation of a private school in a parental choice program under certain circumstances, including if the school misrepresents information, fails to maintain accreditation or meet certain academic standards, or retains a disqualified person.  Under current law, a \"disqualified person\" is one who satisfied one of the following at the time that a private school was barred or terminated from a parental choice program by an order of the department:  1) the person had a controlling ownership interest in, or was the administrator or an officer, director, or trustee of, the private school; 2) the person was designated by the administrator of the private school to assist in processing pupil applications; or 3) the person was responsible for an action or circumstance that led to the private school being barred or terminated from participation in the program.\n\nCurrently, DPI may bar the participation of a private school in a choice program if the private school retains, for compensation or as a volunteer, a disqualified person within seven years after the date of an order issued by DPI.  This bill eliminates the seven-year limit on the person's status as a disqualified person; as a result, DPI may bar from participation in a parental choice program a private school that hires or retains a disqualified person regardless of the amount of time that has passed since the person engaged in the disqualifying activity.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB1021,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  118.60 (1) (ag) (intro.) of the statutes is amended to read:\nAB1021,2,22\n118.60 (1) (ag) (intro.)  \"Disqualified person\" means  a  any of the following:\nAB1021,2,5\n31m.

Larson. Referred to Committee on Rules.\n\nAB1022,1,3\n1An Act to repeal 895.62 and 939.48 (1m) of the statutes; relating to: the 2presumption of reasonableness in a criminal or civil case involving 3self-defense.\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\nUnder current law, in general, a person who uses force in self-defense or in the defense of another person may not be convicted of a crime stemming from that use of force.  This law applies only when: 1) the amount of force used is reasonable; and 2) the person uses that force to prevent or stop what he or she reasonably believes is an unlawful interference with himself or herself or another person, such as the crime of battery.\n\nUnder current law, a factfinder in a criminal case involving a person's use of force intended to or likely to cause death or great bodily harm must presume that the person reasonably believed the force was necessary to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or to another person if: 1) the individual against whom the force was used was in the process of unlawfully and forcibly entering, or had already unlawfully and forcefully entered, the dwelling, motor vehicle, or, in the case of a business owner or operator, place of business of the person who used the force; 2) the person was present in that dwelling, motor vehicle, or place of business; and 3) the person knew or reasonably believed that an unlawful and forcible entry was occurring or had occurred.  Current law prohibits a court from considering whether the person had an opportunity to flee or retreat before he or she used the force.\n\nUnder current law, the presumption does not apply if: 1) the person who used the force was engaged in a criminal activity or was using his or her dwelling, motor vehicle, or place of business to further a criminal activity; or 2) the individual against whom the force was used had identified himself or herself as a public safety worker (or was or should have been known to be a public safety worker) and was entering the dwelling, motor vehicle, or place of business in the performance of his or her official duties.\n\nCurrent law also confers immunity from civil liability for a person who uses force that is intended to or likely to cause death or great bodily harm if the person reasonably believed that the force was necessary to prevent death or bodily harm to himself or herself or to another person and if: 1) the individual against whom the force was used was in the process of unlawfully and forcibly entering, or had already forcibly entered, the dwelling, motor vehicle, or place of business of the person who used the force; 2) the person who used the force was present in the dwelling, motor vehicle, or place of business; and 3) the person who used the force knew or had reason to believe that an unlawful and forcible entry was occurring or had occurred.\n\nFor purposes of civil immunity, a person is not presumed to have reasonably believed that the force was necessary if: 1) the person who used the force was engaged in a criminal activity or was using his or her dwelling, motor vehicle, or place of business to further a criminal activity; or 2) the individual against whom the force was used had identified himself or herself as a public safety worker (or was or should have been known to be a public safety worker) and was entering the dwelling, motor vehicle, or place of business in the performance of his or her official duties.\n\nUnder current law, if a court finds that person who is sued in civil court is immune from liability because he or she used the force reasonably, the person is entitled to attorney fees, court costs, compensation for income loss, and other expenses the person incurred to defend himself or herself against the civil action.\n\nThis bill repeals the presumption of reasonableness in criminal and civil actions, and removes the provisions awarding attorney fees, court costs, compensation for income loss, and other expenses incurred by a person who is sued civilly for using force that is intended to or likely to cause death or great bodily harm.\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB1022,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  895.62 of the statutes is repealed.\nAB1022,2\n\n\n2Section \n2.  939.48 (1m) of the statutes is repealed.\nAB1022,2,33\n(End)\n            Down\r\n        Down\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n"

Current law prohibits, with certain exceptions, the erection or maintenance of outdoor advertising signs within 660 feet of, or beyond 660 feet but visible (and erected for the purpose of being visible) from, the main-traveled way of an interstate or primary highway.  The exceptions to this prohibition include, with some restrictions:\n\n1.  Directional and other official signs, including signs relating to natural wonders and scenic and historical attractions.\n\n2.  Landmark signs.\n\n3.  Signs advertising the sale or lease of property on which the signs are located.\n\n4.  On-premises signs, which are signs advertising activities conducted on the property where the signs are located.\n\n5.  Signs located beyond 660 feet of the highway in urban areas.\n\n6.  Signs located within 660 feet of the highway in areas zoned for business, industrial, or commercial activities, or in unzoned areas used for commercial or industrial activities, that were in existence on March 18, 1972.\n\n7.  Signs located within 660 feet of the highway in areas zoned for business, industrial, or commercial activities, or in unzoned areas used for commercial or industrial activities, that were erected after March 18, 1972.  These signs must comply with certain size, lighting, and spacing requirements (off-premises business area signs).  If, however, a county or local zoning authority has made a determination of customary use regarding size, lighting, and spacing, that determination may be accepted in lieu of the statutory requirements.\n\n8.  Certain signs erected on farm buildings.\n\nThis bill freezes, as of the effective date of the bill, the application of the exception to off-premises business area signs, thereby prohibiting the erection of signs under that exception after the bill's effective date.  Signs erected under this exception prior to the bill's effective date may continue to be maintained and to vary their advertising and informative displays.\n\nThis bill extends the provisions governing outdoor advertising signs along interstate and federal-aid primary highways to all state trunk highways and scenic byways.\n\nUnder this bill, a determination of customary use by a county or local zoning authority does not affect the applicability of statutory size, lighting, or spacing requirements.\n\nUnder current law, the Department of Transportation (DOT) generally may remove signs that do not conform to applicable requirements but, for each sign removed, must pay just compensation to the owner of the sign and to the owner of the land on which the sign is located.  For on-property signs, if the on-property sign was lawful when it was erected but later does not comply with the applicable requirements for on-property signs, DOT must declare the sign to be nonconforming but may not remove the sign unless additional criteria are met.  These signs are not subject to removal for changing the advertising message on the sign or performing customary maintenance on the sign, but are subject to removal, without compensation, if the sign is enlarged, replaced, or relocated or if additional signs are erected.\n\nUnder this bill, \"customary maintenance\" is defined to mean any of the following and similar activities when performed to maintain a sign in substantially the same form as when the sign became non-conforming: preparing surfaces for painting; repairing or replacing fasteners such as nails, screws, or bolts; replacing lighting components and associated fixtures; or fastening broken pieces of a sign back together with glue or fasteners.  Customary maintenance specifically does not include using different materials for any replacement or adding any structural elements such as posts, poles, braces or guy wires, crossbeams, or sign faces.  Also under this bill, the owner of a nonconforming on-property sign must maintain a record of all work performed on the sign, including a photograph of each item of work performed, and provide a report to DOT of the work performed.\n\nUnder current law, off-premises business area signs may not contain flashing, intermittent, or moving lights, except:\n\n1.  Those signs giving public service information.\n\n2.  Certain signs that contain multiple or variable messages, including messages on louvers that are rotated and messages formed solely by use of lights or other electronic or digital displays.\n\nUnder this bill, the exception from the prohibition of flashing, intermittent, or moving lights for certain signs that contain multiple or variable messages is eliminated.\n\nUnder this bill, DOT must promulgate rules establishing size, height, setback, brightness, and hours of operation standards for signs that are illuminated.  Signs may be illuminated only if the owner of the sign has received a permit from DOT, which is issued if the sign complies with DOT illumination rules.\n\nThis bill requires DOT to conduct biennial surveys of signs.  A survey must include all of the following for each sign:\n\n1.  A photograph of each side.\n\n2.  Approximate measurement of the length and height.\n\n3.  An assessment of the sign's structural type.\n\n4.  Approximate measurement of the distance from each sign to the center line of the adjacent highway and to the nearest sign.\n\nUnder this bill, DOT must maintain a database of information related to signs.  The database must include the information from DOT sign surveys and all of the following information for each sign:\n\n1.  The name and address of the owner.\n\n2.  The name and address of the installer.\n\n3.  The name and address of the owner of the parcel on which the sign is located.\n\n4.  The name and address of any occupant of the parcel on which the sign is located.\n\n5.  Zoning and land use status of the parcel on which the sign is located.\n\n6.  If commercial or industrial activity occurs on the parcel on which the sign is located, a description of the activity.\n\n7.  Any other information required by DOT.\n\nAlso under this bill, an owner of a sign must provide any information required to be included in the database to DOT and must update the information whenever the information in the database is no longer accurate.\n\nUnder current law, no person may erect or maintain an outdoor advertising sign visible from the main-traveled way of an interstate or federal-aid highway unless he or she possesses a license issued by DOT, the sign complies with applicable regulations, and, if DOT has promulgated a rule requiring payment of an annual permit fee for the sign, the person has paid the annual permit fee.\n\nUnder this bill, DOT must establish a license fee and an annual permit fee.  DOT is required to set the fees so as to recover its approximate costs of regulating outdoor advertising signs.\n\nUnder current law, DOT is responsible for maintenance of the highway right-of-way on highways that, for maintenance purposes, are under its jurisdiction, which are generally state trunk highways (including interstate highways) but do not include connecting highways. DOT must provide for the care and protection of trees and other roadside vegetation. DOT must also cut, trim, or remove, or allow others to cut, trim, or remove, trees and other vegetation in order to provide safety to highway users. Current law generally prohibits a person from cutting, trimming, removing, or planting a tree or other vegetation within the right-of-way of a state trunk highway without DOT's consent.\n\nCurrently, DOT administers a permit system for the maintenance and removal by sign owners of vegetation obstructing the view of signs along state trunk highways, including interstate highways. DOT is required to issue permits to sign owners for the trimming or removal of vegetation in the highway right-of-way if, within a distance of 500 continuous feet along the highway, the vegetation obstructs motorists' view of the face of a sign. A permit authorizes the sign owner, or a third-party contractor employed by the sign owner, to trim or remove obstructing vegetation to the extent necessary to eliminate the obstruction and restore an unobstructed view of the sign for the 500 continuous feet along the highway.  Each permit must require a sign owner that removes certain planted vegetation to plant comparable replacement vegetation or compensate DOT for the removed vegetation.\n\nThis bill eliminates the permit system for the maintenance and removal by sign owners of vegetation obstructing the view of signs along state trunk highways.\n\nUnder current law, towns and counties are authorized to regulate the maintenance and construction of billboards and other similar structures on premises abutting on certain highways in the town or county so as to promote the safety of public travel on the highways.\n\nUnder this bill, a city, village, town, or county may enact an ordinance that regulates the construction and maintenance of billboards and other similar structures on premises abutting on highways that are maintained by the city, village, town, or county.  If enacted, such an ordinance must promote aesthetic values and public safety on the highways.\n\nThis bill prohibits any office, department, or independent agency in the executive branch, the legislature, or the courts from purchasing, leasing, accepting, or using billboard space on nonconforming signs.\n\nUnder current law, the Department of Tourism may award joint effort marketing funds to nonprofit organizations, including American Indian tribes or bands, for projects designed to promote attractions and facilities in this state.  While an applicant for joint effort marketing funds must specify the advertising media to be used in a project funded by the funds, there is no restriction on the kinds of media that may be used.  This bill prohibits the use of joint effort marketing funds for advertising on nonconforming signs.\n            Down\r\n        Down\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Up\r\n        Up\r\n\nFor further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as an appendix to this bill.\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows:\nAB1023,1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  20.395 (9) (aq) of the statutes is created to read:\nAB1023,5,32\n20.395 (9) (aq)  Outdoor advertising regulation.

F.E.C., the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that corporations are \"persons\" for the purpose of political speech, thus allowing corporations to make unlimited expenditures in political campaigns.  The U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power to propose amendments to the Constitution that become effective when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the states.  Amendments can have the effect of overturning—in effect repealing—prior decisions of the Supreme Court.  This resolution places a question on the November 2016 ballot to ask the people if Congress should propose an amendment to overturn \nCitizens United v. F.E.C.\n\n\nAJR8,1,4\n2Resolved by the assembly, the senate concurring, That the following 3question be submitted, for advisory purposes only, to the voters of this state at the 4general election to be held in November 2016:\nAJR8,2,2\n5\"The U.S. Supreme Court's decisions in Citizens United and related cases allow 6unlimited spending to influence local, state, and federal elections.  To allow all 7Americans to have an equal say in our democracy, shall Wisconsin's congressional 1delegation support, and the Wisconsin legislature ratify, an amendment to the U.S. 2Constitution stating:\nAJR8,2,43\n1.  Only human beings—not corporations, unions, nonprofit organizations, or 4similar associations—are endowed with constitutional rights, and\nAJR8,2,65\n2.  Money is not speech, and therefore limiting political contributions and 6spending is not equivalent to restricting political speech?\"\nAJR8,2,77\n(End)\n            Down\r\n        Down\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n"
